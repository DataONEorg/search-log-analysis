            <abstract>The U.S. Geological Survey's Upper Midwest Environmental Sciences Center (UMESC) has created high-resolution land cover/use data sets for selected areas in the Upper Mississippi River (UMR) from 1:15,000-scale color infrared aerial photos collected in 1994. These data have been interpreted to delineate three feature types, land cover/land use, percent of vegetation cover, and tree height. The areas which were photographed and interpreted are navigation Pools 7, 8, and 26.</abstract>
            <purpose>The Upper Midwest Environmental Sciences Center administers the Long Term Resource Monitoring Program (LTRMP), authorized under the Water Resources Development Act of 1986 (Public Law 99-662). The mission of the LTRMP is to provide decision makers with information to maintain the Upper Mississippi River System (UMRS) as a viable large river ecosystem given its multiple-use character. The long-term goals of the Program are to understand the system, determine resource trends and impacts, develop management alternatives, manage information, and develop useful products. The creation and distribution of high-resolution land cover/use data for the UMRS aids the Center in meeting these goals.</purpose>

        <attracc>
            <attraccr>The attribute accuracy for this data set is tested by manually comparing hard copy plots to the original base map or mylar overlay. Some comparison may be done on-screen if areas on the test plot are unclear. The attributes are also checked against an all inclusive list of possible attributes for the data set. If needed the attributes are also verified to the photo interpretation for the data set.</attraccr>
        </attracc>
        <logic>All polygon features are checked for topology using the ARC/INFO software. Each polygon begins and ends at the same point with the node feature. All nodes are checked for error so that there are no dangling features. There are no duplicate lines or polygons. All nodes will snap together and close polygons based on a specified tolerance. If the node is not with the tolerance it is adjusted manually. The tests for logical consistency are performed in ARC/INFO using certain commands.</logic>
        <complete>All data that was photo-interpreted is also automated. This includes submergent classes, emergents, grasses, trees and also linear features such as streams and banks. The data were interpreted using a 1-acre 10% vegetation cover minimum mapping unit.</complete>

            <vertacc>
                <vertaccr>The horizontal positional accuracy is tested by visual comparison of the data with hard copy maps and on-screen with existing data sets that cover the same area. The original basemaps onto which the aerial photo overlays were transferred, were 1:15,000-scale enlargements of 1:24,000-scale (24K) U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) quadrangles. As digital orthophoto quadrangles (DOQs) became available these data were used as the registration basemaps. DOQ files are positionally more accurate than the 24K USGS quadrangles, and it is easier to align photo features with a DOQ than it is with the abstract representations found on a standard USGS quadrangle.</vertaccr>
