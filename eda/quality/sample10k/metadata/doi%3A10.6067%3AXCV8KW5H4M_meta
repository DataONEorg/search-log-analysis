Sampling for Unit 208 and a portion of 165 was conducted using 6 by 6 foot block excavations divided into four quadrants while Unit 250 and a portion of 165 was excavated in sixteen 45.7 cm (18 in) squares. Debris measuring one inch or larger was plotted two-dimensionally within each 2-inch level. Additionally, three site-long, 45.7 cm wide transects were excavated across Horizon 11, two of which ran through units 208 and 165. Objects larger than .6 cm (.25 in) recovered from the transects were piece-plotted with three dimensional provenience information. The heavy fraction flotation sample was sieved through 4mm, 3mm and 2mm U.S. standard geological sieves, with analysis and identification conducted on specimens 2mm or larger. Analysis and identification of the macro- and micro-remains was performed by Boon using comparative collections at the Illinois State Museum Research and Collections Center and Indiana University of Pennsylvania, Department of Anthropology. </abstract><created xsi:type="W3CDTF">2015-01-15T14:28:50-07:00</created><bibliographicCitation>Boon Horizon Eleven Dataset.
