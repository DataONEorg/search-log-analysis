 <abstract><para>Data packages available consist of soil volumetric water content (VWC) data collected continuously from May 2009 to October 2010. Data are available at 10 min resolution. VWC probes were installed at five depths into the soil of different land covers within a montane cloud belt in central Veracruz, Mexico. The investigated land covers were: i) an old-growth lower montane cloud forest catchment (MAT), ii) a 20-year old regenerating lower montane cloud forest catchment (SEC), iii) a slope grazing pasture (PASs), iv) a flat grazing pasture (PASf), v) a 10-year old Pinus patula reforestation (YREF), and vi) a mature P. patula plantation under selective logging (MREF). As recommended for volcanic soils, VWC probes were individually calibrated with gravimetric measurements conducted after the measuring period using the surrounding soil where the probes were installed. Standard and routine soil characterization of each horizon to a depth of 1.5 m were conducted at the time of probe installation and are also available as part of these packages. Data were collected for the purpose of studying ecohydrological processes across land covers in a seasonally dry cloud forest zone.</para>

<methods><methodStep><description><section><title>Data from old-growth cloud forest (MAT), 20-year old regenerating cloud forest (SEC) and a slope grazing pasture (PASs)</title>
<para>Soil VWC was measured every 10 min from 1 May 2009 to 30 September 2010. Measurements were made at three different positions in the MAT and SEC (ridge top, midslope, and near- stream valley bottom) along a south-facing hillslope transect; meanwhile in the PAS two topographic positions were monitored (mid-ridge and mid-toe slope) The instrumented hillslope in the  MAT was 250 m long, with an average slope of 30 degrees; at SEC was 282 m long with average slope of 30 degrees; and, at PASs the slope was 220 m long with an average slope of 30 degrees. At each position, five soil moisture probes were installed horizontally at different depths according to the array of horizons observed in the first 1.5 m of soil. Depths at MAT were 8, 20, 40, 65 and 95 cm on average; at SEC these were 6, 26, 68, 110 and 131 cm; and, at PAS depths monitored were 5, 23, 48, 78 and 107 cm.</para>

<para>Soil VWC was measured every 10 min from May 2009 to May 2010 at YREF, PASf and two locations at MREF (MREF1 and MREF2). Measurements were made near tree sapflow monitoring plots at YREF and MREF, which were South-East facing with average slope of 20 and 25 degrees, respectively. At each site, five soil moisture probes were installed horizontally at different depths according to the array of horizons observed in the first 1.5 m of soil. Depths monitored at PASf were 5, 10, 15, 30 and 100 cm. For YREF these depths were 5, 19, 36, 70 and 123 cm. At MREF1 probes were installed at 10, 35, 58, 85, 115 cm deep, while at MREF2 the depths were 10, 25, 40, 87 and 115 cm.</para>

<methodStep><description><section><title>VWC probe calibration and raw data correction</title>
<para>When the observation period concluded, each VWC probe was calibrated at the Soil Laboratory of the Instituto de Ecologia A.C., Xalapa, Veracruz using undisturbed soil cores with a diameter of 10.4 cm and a length of 20 cm extracted from the field using PVC tubes (E. Hincapie et al., manuscript in preparation, 2013). The calibration followed the standard procedure outlined by Starr, J. L., and I. C. Palineanu (2002), Methods for measurement of soil water content: Capacitance devices, in Methods of Soil Analysis: Part 4 Physical Methods, edited by J. H. Dane and G. C. Topp, pp. 463-474, Soil Sci. Soc. of Am., Madison, Wisc. Calibration equations used to correct raw readings from each individual probe are available upon request.</para>
