 <abstract><para>台灣泡桐早年曾被譽為台灣的綠色黃金，並且在1960-1970年代被廣泛種植。然而1980年代，台灣泡桐造林地普遍受到泡桐簇葉病 (Paulownia Witches' broom, PaWB)的為害，嚴重摧毀了泡桐產業。泡桐簇葉病的病原是植物菌質體 (phytoplasma)，屬蟲媒傳播之系統性病害，同時也可經由受感染的無性繁殖材料快速傳播。泡桐簇葉病目前尚無有效的藥劑防治措施，本計畫針對泡桐簇葉病開發了PCR診斷方法，配合專一性引子對，可用於簇葉病發病生態及抗病品種篩選的研究。針對不同泡桐品系苗木進行接種試驗，並使用PCR技術監測菌質體增殖的情形，結果顯示接種並確認感染的泡桐苗木不同部位的菌植體濃度以葉脈最高，其次為莖部、葉肉及皮層含量最低。接種測試結果顯示台灣泡桐完全不抗病，貴州泡桐以及白桐與貴州泡桐的雜交品系則呈現不同程度的耐抗病性。顯示接種測試配合PCR檢測，可以加速篩選耐抗病的雜交泡桐品系。為了解泡桐簇葉病四季發病情形，並監測菌質體在泡桐植株內的周年變化，自2014年2月開始至2015年6月為止，針對台東樣區17株樣木進行逐月採樣，PCR結果顯示菌質體數量在泡桐植株內有隨季節消長的情形。菌質體含量以及發病率在夏季達到高峰，且PCR檢測可以在病徵未出現前偵測到菌質體。經由田間採集以及人工餵蟲傳播試驗證實茶翅椿(Halyomorpha mista)是泡桐簇葉病的媒介昆蟲。田間族群調查發現，茶翅椿族群數量在一年中有兩個高峰期，分別出現在3至4月及8至10月間。此外在太麻里試驗區亦觀察到另一種可能的媒介昆蟲黃斑椿象（Erthesina fullo)。藉由PCR檢測技術進行田間泡桐林木及媒介昆蟲帶原率監測，並持續追蹤媒介昆蟲族群變化，可以做為防治最佳時機之判斷依據進而擬訂防治對策。雖然病蟲害監測可以協助早期防治泡桐簇葉病，然而，選育優良的抗耐病泡桐品系以及培育健康種苗，將會是建立健康泡桐產業更重要的關鍵。<value xml:lang="EN">Paulownia taiwaniana is a fast-growing timber species, which was earlier hailed as Taiwan’s green gold and planted extensively during the 1960s and 1970s. However, in the 1980s, paulownia witches’ broom (PaWB) infection destroyed paulownia plantations and resulted in significant economic losses. Phytoplasma is the causative agent of PaWB, which can be transmitted by vector insects and infected propagation materials. So far, no effective chemical treatment strategy is available for PaWB control. In this project specific and effective PCR primer of PaWB phytoplasma was designed and applied for PaWB detection, field research and resistant breeding. Phytoplasma was artificially inoculated onto healthy paulownia seedlings to evaluate resistance or tolerance of different paulownia clones to PaWB. PCR with specific PaWB primers was carried out to monitor the distribution and concentration of phytoplasma in inoculated paulownia seedlings. The PCR results indicated concentrations of PaWB in mesophyll, petioles, veins and bark of infected paulownia seedlings were from high to low, respectively. Artificial inoculation of test paulownia seedlings indicated P. taiwaniana plants were susceptible, however, seedlings of P. fortunei and P. kawakamii x P. fortunei hybrids showed varying degrees of tolerance to PaWB. The results showed artificial inoculation testing with PCR testing accelerate screening paulownia strains resistant or tolerant to PaWB. 17 paulownia plants in Taitung area were sampled monthly from February 2014 to June 2015 to evaluate the infection rate and variation of phytoplasma concentration in paulownia plants. PCR results indicated phytoplasma content in paulownia plants showed seasonal fluctuation. Phytoplasma content and incidence rate peaked in the summer, and the PCR test can detect the early presence of phytoplasma before symptoms occurred. The results of field collection, of artificial feeding test, and PCR test confirmed Halyomorpha mista as an insect vector could sucessfully transmitted phytoplasma. Field tracking indicated that the population of H. mista peaked in March to April and August to October, repectively. Meanwhile, a yellow-spotted stink bug, Erthesina fullo, was observed in Taitung sample area, and suspected as another possible insect vector of PaWB. Information provided by monitoring the population change of vector insects and using PCR technique to monitor phytoplasma infection rate of paulownia plantations and of vector insects can be used to judge the best time of prevention and to develop better disease and pest control strategies. Pest and disease monitoring can help early prevention of PaWB, however, to establish a healthy paulownia industry, breeding of elite disease-resistant paulownia clones and nurturing healthy seedlings, will be the more important key.</value>

 <methods><methodStep><description><section><title>Specific primers for PaWBP</title>
 <para>Two opposing primers for PCR-based detection of PaWBP were chosen from the sequence of cloned PaWBP-specific DNA fragments. The primer pair, composed of the forward primer (5’-TCCATG TCT CTT TCA ATT CCT-3’) and reverse primer (5’-AAA AGC TAT TCA AAATTA TGC C-3’), were designed to amplify a 510 bp PaWBP-specific DNA fragment by PCR.</para>

 <methodStep><description><section><title>Preparations of DNA samples for PCR</title>
 <para>For rapid mass-screening, mini-preparations of total nucleic acid extracts of PaWBP infected samples were used as templates for the PCR. Nucleic acid samples were prepared using a method described by Lee and Davis (1988), Lee et al. (1988), and Lee et al. (1990) with minor modifications Mesophyll (ca.500 mg) was powdered in liquid nitrogen,and each sample was suspended in 1.5 mL of DNA extraction buffer (0.1 M Tris-HCl [pH8.0], 0.05 M EDTA, 0.5 M NaCl, and 1% Nlauroylsarcosine), and transferred to a 1.5-mL eppendorf tube. After incubation at 55℃for 1 h, the sample was centrifuged at 4000 xg for 5 min. After the supernatant (ca. 800 μL) was collected, 100 μL of 5 M NaCl and 100 μL of 10% hexadecyl-trimethyl-ammoniumbromide (CTAB) in 0.7 M NaCl were added, and the mixture was incubated at 65℃for 10 min. The sample was subjected to 1 cycle of chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (24: 1) extraction, and the aqueous supernatant was then reextracted with an additional cycle of phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25: 24: 1). The nucleic acids were precipitated by mixing 600μL of the supernatant and 360 μL of isopropanol followed by centrifugation at 12,000xg for 10 min. The pellets were washed with 70% ethanol, dried, and resuspended in 150μL of TE buffer.</para>

After electrophoresis, the gel was stained with ethidium bromide (0.5 μg/mL) and photographed. A 100-bp DNA ladder set (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) was included as a size marker.

 <para>PaWBP-infected paulownia (P. taiwaniana) tissues with characteristic symptoms of PaWB were collected from the Lienhwachih research center of the Taiwan Forestry Research Institute and used in this study. Twenty-one paulownia hybrids and 3 purebred plants were obtained from pathogen-free seedlings through shoot-tip grafting techniques and kept in an insect-proof greenhouse. PaWBP infected paulownia buds were side-grafted onto healthy paulownia plants as inoculum sources. Healthy paulownia seeedlings were aseptically germinated in a growth chamber and used as negative controls. Monitoring of PaWBP was conducted using a PCR assay with PaWBP-specific primers, and symptoms were recorded.</para>

 <methodStep><description><section><title>Insect vector trasmission test</title>
 <para>PaWBP-free bugs (H. mista) were initiated from single females collected from PaWBP-free paulownia (P. taiwaniana) plants. These bugs were added to caged pods of PaWBP-free paulownia plants at 25~28℃, under a 16-h light and 8-h dark cycle. After starvation for 30 min, the adults were put in a Petri dish for a 24-h acquisition feeding period of paulownia infected with PaWBP. These viruliferous adults were transferred to healthy paulownia seedlings for a 24-h inoculation access period and then eliminated with an insecticide. Inoculated paulownia plants were cultivated at 25~28℃. Transmission was determined according to the results of a PCR analysis and symptom development. For the study of bug-transmission, adult bugs were moved to a PaWBP-infected paulownia plant for a 24-h acquisition access period (AAP). These viruliferous adults were then collected and divided into 5 groups including single, 5, 10, 20, and 50 adults, respectively. PaWBP-free paulownia plants (1 mo old and 10 cm tall) were individually inoculated with single, 5, 10, 20, and 50 viruliferous adults for the inoculation access period (IAP).</para>
