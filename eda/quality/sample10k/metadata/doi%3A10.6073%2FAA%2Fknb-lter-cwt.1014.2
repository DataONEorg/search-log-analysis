These measurements are analysis of plant nitrogen availability and overall site productivity.</para><para>Potential nitrogen transformation rates (net nitrification and mineralization) are measured using closed core in situ incubations of the 0-10 cm of mineral soil for 28 days. Two cores are driven into the top 10 cm of soil 25 cm apart. One core is removed and represents t=0 NH4+ and NO3- concentrations. The other core is capped with a PVC cap and left in place for 28 days. Incubations are performed at randomly selected points on each of four transects on each LTER plot, these transects are used as replicates. Three sets of nitrogen transformation measurements are conducted on the extensive plots. NH4+- and NO3- nitrogen concentrations are measured in fresh soil sieved (6mm) extracted with 2 M KCl (10 g soil:20 ml KCl) for 1 hour.</para></abstract><keywordSet><keyword>Coweeta</keyword><keyword>LTER</keyword><keyword>Nitrogen</keyword><keyword>transformation</keyword><keyword>nitrification</keyword><keyword>mineralization</keyword></keywordSet><intellectualRights><para>Must adhere to the Coweeta LTER Data Policy (See http://coweeta.ecology.uga.edu/webdocs/3/static/datapolicies.html).</para></intellectualRights><distribution scope="document"><online><url function="download">http://cwt33.ecology.uga.edu/summaries/summary1014.html</url></online></distribution><coverage scope="document"><geographicCoverage scope="document"><geographicDescription>WS18 and WS27</geographicDescription><boundingCoordinates><westBoundingCoordinate></westBoundingCoordinate><eastBoundingCoordinate></eastBoundingCoordinate><northBoundingCoordinate></northBoundingCoordinate><southBoundingCoordinate></southBoundingCoordinate></boundingCoordinates></geographicCoverage><temporalCoverage scope="document"><rangeOfDates><beginDate><calendarDate>1991-05-01</calendarDate></beginDate><endDate><calendarDate>1995-01-01</calendarDate></endDate></rangeOfDates></temporalCoverage></coverage><contact scope="document"><positionName>Coweeta LTER Information Manager</positionName><address scope="document"><deliveryPoint>Institute of Ecology</deliveryPoint><deliveryPoint>University of Georgia</deliveryPoint><city>Athens</city><administrativeArea>Georgia</administrativeArea><postalCode>30602</postalCode><country>USA</country></address><phone phonetype="voice">(828) 524-2128</phone></contact><project scope="document"><title>Coweeta Long Term Ecological Research</title><personnel scope="document"><individualName><givenName>Ted</givenName><surName>Gragson</surName></individualName><address scope="document"><deliveryPoint>Institute of Ecology</deliveryPoint><deliveryPoint>University of Georgia</deliveryPoint><city>Athens</city><administrativeArea>Georgia</administrativeArea><postalCode>30602</postalCode><country>USA</country></address><electronicMailAddress>tgragson@earthlink.net</electronicMailAddress><role>principalInvestigator</role></personnel><personnel scope="document"><individualName><givenName>James</givenName><surName>Vose</surName></individualName><address scope="document"><deliveryPoint>Institute of Ecology</deliveryPoint><deliveryPoint>University of Georgia</deliveryPoint><city>Athens</city><administrativeArea>Georgia</administrativeArea><postalCode>30602</postalCode><country>USA</country></address><electronicMailAddress>jvose@fs.fed.us</electronicMailAddress><role>principalInvestigator</role></personnel><personnel scope="document"><individualName><givenName>Brian</givenName><surName>Kloeppel</surName></individualName><address scope="document"><deliveryPoint>Institute of Ecology</deliveryPoint><deliveryPoint>University of Georgia</deliveryPoint><city>Athens</city><administrativeArea>Georgia</administrativeArea><postalCode>30602</postalCode><country>USA</country></address><electronicMailAddress>kloeppel@sparc.ecology.uga.edu</electronicMailAddress><role>principalInvestigator</role></personnel><abstract><para>The Coweeta LTER Research Program has evolved since 1980 from a site-based to a site- and region-based project examining the effects of disturbance
and environmental gradients on biogeochemical cycling, and the underlying
watershed ecosystem processes that regulate and respond to those cycles. 
The objective for the 2002-2008 research is to advance scientific
understanding of the spatial, temporal, and decision-making components of
land use and land-use change in the southern Appalachian Mountains over the
last 200 years, and forecast patterns into the future 30 years.  This will
be accomplished by addressing ecological and socioeconomic aspects of
land-use change while continuing long-term studies of environmental
gradients and natural disturbance regimes.  The result will be a more
complete understanding of ecological dynamics in the southern Appalachian
Mountains that makes possible the development of reasonable forecasts of
its future ecological state. | The guiding hypothesis for the proposed research is that the frequency, intensity, and extent of land use represents human decision-making in
response to socioeconomic and bio-geophysical conditions with consequences
that cascade through ecosystems.  The research activities are organized
into three initiatives: (1) Characterization of the Socio-Natural Template,
(2) Ecosystem Responses to the Socio-Natural Template, and (3) Forecasting
Ecosystem Responses to Changes in the Socio-Natural Template.  The
integrated scientific research will provide both a description as well as
an explanation of the underlying causes of land use and the consequences of
land-use change for southern Appalachian ecosystems and society.  It thus
recognizes the complexity of land use as a process and the research needs
as defined in the LTER Program and the broader scientific community.</para></abstract><funding><para>National Science Foundation.
