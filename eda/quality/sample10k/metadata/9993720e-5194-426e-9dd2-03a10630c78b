      <abstract>Accurate estimates of ground-water discharge are crucial in the development of a water budget for the Basin and Range Carbonate-rock Aquifer System (BARCAS) study area. One common method used throughout the southwest United States is to estimate ground-water discharge from evapotranspiration (ET). ET is a process by which water from the Earth's surface is transferred to the atmosphere. The volume of water lost to the atmosphere by ET can be computed as the product of the ET rate and the acreage of vegetation, open water, and moist soil through which ET occurs. The procedure used in the study, groups areas of similar vegetation, water, and soil conditions into different ET units and assigns an average annual ET rate to each unit. The data sets and the procedures used to delineate the ET-unit map are described in this metadata.</abstract>
      <purpose>The ET-unit map described and documented was used specifically to calculate annual ET from potential areas of ground-water discharge. ET calculated from the ET-unit map was then partitioned into surface-water and ground-water components to estimate ground-water discharge from hydrographic areas and hydrographic-area subbasins within the study area.</purpose>
      <supplinf>The data sets used to develop the ET-unit map are based on Landsat satellite data. The SWReGAP program developed a five state land cover map based on ecological systems. The ecological systems describing water, marshlands, and playa were used to delineate those ET units. Landsat data was acquired for the dates of July 3 and 12 of 2005. To delineate ET units of shrubs and grasses, the Landsat data was used to produce the Modified Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (MSAVI), an index that relates to the greenness and density of plant growth. The ET units of meadowland, grassland, dense desert shrubland, moderately dense desert shrubland, and sparse desert shrubland were delineated. The 2005 imagery was also used to produce the Tasseled Cap transformation. The brightness, greenness, and moisture bands were used to identify ET units of moist bare soil. The 2005 imagery, along with Landsat imagery from 2002 and 2000 was used to identify recently irrigated croplands by photo interpretation.</supplinf>

The final data set was compared with the false color composite Landsat imagery of 2005.  The ET units visually appeared to represent what was on the ground.  A field accuracy assessment was conducted in August and September of 2006 and is reported in Smith and others (2007).</attraccr>

Landsat Thematic Mapper imagery was acquired; entity-id lt5039032000019419, June 12, 2005 and entity-id lt5040032000018400, July 3, 2005.  All acquired imagery was georeferenced to allow geospatial evaluations and direct comparison with other spatially referenced datasets. Georeferencing assigns map coordinates to an image by using known ground control points and the corresponding image row and column. A mathematical transformation equation is determined to relate the image to map coordinates. Previously georeferenced Landsat imagery by the USGS that was acquired in 2000 was used in the georeferencing process. Corrections to georeference the 2005 images were applied by using a first-order polynomial equation. Each 2005 multi-path image used between 30 and 35 control points. The root mean square (RMS) error or positional accuracy for each multi-path image was about 100 ft.
		
Image standardization is the process of normalizing imaged spectral data for differences in sun illumination geometry, atmospheric effects, and instrument calibration. Standardization is required to accurately compare pixel spectral reflectance between images of different dates. Pixel values in each image were standardized by using software developed and distributed by the Remote Sensing and GIS Laboratory of Utah State University: http://www.gis.usu.edu/docs/projects/swgap/ImageStandardization.htm. For atmospheric corrections, the technique COST without Tau was used.  For each image, the haze correction was 8 and 4 digital numbers for bands 3 and 4, respectively.
		
A vegetation index is a number that is generated by the combination of remote sensing bands and has some relation to the amount of vegetation in a given pixel. The Modified Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (MSAVI) is an index which removes soil influences from the vegetation index at sparse plant cover.  A ERDAS Imagine graphics model found at http://gi.leica-geosystems.com/LGISub2x236x8.aspx was used.
		
The Tasseled Cap transformation compresses all the TM spectral data into a few bands associated with physical scene characteristics of brightness, greenness, and wetness.  Programs to compute the Tasseled Cap were obtained from the EROS Data Center.  The Tasseled Cap brightness, greenness, and wetness bands were used to map areas of moist bare soil. An unsupervised classification (ISODATA) based on these three bands was performed on the data set. Unsupervised classification clusters pixels in a data set based on statistics only, without any user-defined training classes. Yelland Dry Lake in northern Spring Valley and an area around Twin Springs in northern Snake Valley were used to identify the moist bare soil classes in the classification.

Selected classes of the SWReGAP that conform with characteristics of defined ET units were used in developing ET-unit distributions. The ET units defined by SWReGAP classes are marshlands, dry playa, and open water bodies. These were extracted from the data set.
		
MSAVI values are dimensionless and range from -1.0 to 1.0. For this study, values from 0 to 1 were scaled from 0 to 200. Values less than 0 were set to 0. Values 0 to 15 were identified as xerophyte, 16 to 20 are sparse desert shrubland, 21 to 28 are moderately dense desert shrubland, 29 to 43 are dense desert shrubland, 44 to 55 are grassland, and 56 to 92 are meadowland. The MSAVI values from 93 to 200 usually occurred where ET units were assigned to recently irrigated cropland or marshland. If not, they were assigned to meadowland.
		
The Tasseled Cap class value which identified the moist bare soil was extracted from the data set.
		
A filtering technique was applied to all ET units except those representing recently irrigated cropland and those developed from SWReGAP. The filtering technique added and removed pixels on the basis of a minimum mapping unit. The minimum mapping unit was set at four adjacent pixels which measure about 35,350 square feet or 0.8 acre in the source imagery. This was accomplished using REGIONGROUP with eight connectivity cells.  Those regions with a count of pixels less than or equal to 3 were identified and used as a mask with the NIBBLE command.  Each hydrographic area was filtered separately.  All areas were then merged back together.
		
The initial ET-unit map was assembled by first using the MSAVI data set. The moist bare soil ET unit, derived by the Tasseled Cap procedure, replaced the MSAVI data wherever moist bare soil occurred. The ET units of marshland, open water, and dry playa, derived from the SWReGAP data, replaced the previous MSAVI and Tasseled Cap data wherever those ET units occurred. Finally, the recently irrigated cropland, derived from photo interpretation of the three Landsat data sets, replaced ET units from the other data sets wherever recently irrigated cropland occurred.
