Electricity was used experimentally to exclude large (approximately &amp;gt;1cm in length) biota without artificially increasing sedimentation as in cage enclosure/exclosure experiments in stream systems. Shrimp (&amp;gt;1cm in length) were excluded from substrata by semicircular fence hooked up to battery-powered fence chargers which emitted continuous pulses of electricity. Unelectrified control substrata had natural high densities of atyid shrimp. Significantly greater masses of total sediment, fine and large organic particles, and algal biovolume occurred in shrimp exclusion treatments relative to controls. Shrimp exclusion treatments experienced slow and steady accumulation of sediments under base flow conditions and a large stepwise increase in sediment following a storm. No measurable sediment accrued in the presence of natural densities of shrimp under base flow conditions. Shrimp rapidly removed sediments that accrued during the storm (440-620 g*m2 dry mass-1), decreasing sediment mass in control treatments to near prestorm levels (5-13 g*m2 dry mass-1) within 30 h. Atyid shrimp can significantly affect the accumulation of organic and inorganic materials on rock substrata in stream pools between high-discharge events.</literalLayout></para></abstract><keywordSet><keyword>Atyid</keyword><keyword>Puerto Rico</keyword><keyword>Xiphocaris</keyword><keyword>algae</keyword><keyword>algae</keyword><keyword>algal biovolume</keyword><keyword>blue-green filamentous</keyword><keyword>diatoms</keyword><keyword>electro exclusion</keyword><keyword>montane streams</keyword><keyword>organic particles</keyword><keyword>sediment</keyword><keyword>shrimps</keyword><keyword>DECAPODS</keyword><keyword>PEER REVIEWED JOURNAL</keyword><keyword>Q TORONJA</keyword><keyword>RIVER</keyword><keyword>SEDIMENTATION</keyword><keyword>Population Dynamics</keyword><keyword>Spatial and temporal distribution</keyword></keywordSet><intellectualRights><section><title>ADEQUATE ACKNOWLEDGEMENT</title><para><literalLayout>The scientists, the LEF-LTER Program, and the                                     USDA International Institute of Tropical Forestry (IITF) must                                     receive adequate acknowledgement for the use of data by other                                     scientists, and the LEF LTER program must receive two copies of                                     any publication using that data.

It has a warm                                 and wet climate and includes a variety of tropical habitats and                                 forest types and streams, and a high diversity of plants and                                 animals. A key feature of these ecosystems is disturbance.                                 Hurricanes, landslides, and human disturbance have shaped the                                 forest, and research by LUQ has stimulated a new appreciation of the                                 significance of large-scale disturbances in tropical forested                                 ecosystems and the key role of plants and animals in shaping the                                 response to these events. Hurricanes occurring one and 10 years                                 after LUQ began in 1988 provided landscape-scale natural experiments                                 which are still followed closely.</geographicDescription><boundingCoordinates><westBoundingCoordinate>-65.92</westBoundingCoordinate><eastBoundingCoordinate>-65.7</eastBoundingCoordinate><northBoundingCoordinate>18.35</northBoundingCoordinate><southBoundingCoordinate>18.23</southBoundingCoordinate><boundingAltitudes><altitudeMinimum>20</altitudeMinimum><altitudeMaximum>1060</altitudeMaximum><altitudeUnits>meter</altitudeUnits></boundingAltitudes></boundingCoordinates></geographicCoverage></coverage><contact scope="document"><individualName><givenName>Catherine</givenName><surName>Pringle</surName></individualName><organizationName>University of Georgia</organizationName><positionName>Principal Investigator</positionName><address scope="document"><deliveryPoint>Institute of Ecology and Department of zoology</deliveryPoint><city>Athens</city><administrativeArea>GA</administrativeArea><postalCode>30602</postalCode><country>USA</country></address><phone phonetype="voice">(706)542-4289</phone><phone phonetype="fax">(706)542-3344</phone><electronicMailAddress>cpringle@uga.edu</electronicMailAddress></contact><publisher scope="document"><organizationName>Luquillo Experimental Forest LTER</organizationName><address scope="document"><deliveryPoint>University of Puerto Rico, Rio Piedras</deliveryPoint><deliveryPoint>P.

In the first one (catalogued as LUQMetadataAS #104) the hypothesis that differences in macrobiotic assemblages can lead to differences in the quantity and quality of organic matter in benthic depositional environmentsamong streams in montane Puerto Rico was tested. The experimental results were consistent with findings of an independent survey of six streams in four different drainages. Four streams that had an abundance of omnivorous shrimps but lacked predaceous fishes, had extremely low levels of fine benthic organic and inorganic material. In contrast, two streams that had low densities of shrimps and contained predaceous fishes had significantly higher levels. Results showed a strong linkage between species and ecosystem characteristics: interstream differences in the quantity and quality of fine benthic organic matter resources were determined by the nature of the macrobiotic assemblage. Furthermore, patterns in the distribution of shrimp assemblages reflected landscape patterns in the benthic depositional environment among streams.  In the second experiment (LUQMetadataAS #105) the role of freshwater shrimp, which dominate the faunal biomass of many tropical headwater streams, was studied. The enclosure/exclosure experiments in a montane Puerto Rican stream the direct and indirect effects of two dominant taxa of atyid (Atyidae) shrimp, Atya lanipes Holthius and Xiphocaris elongata Guerin-Meneville was examined. Both shrimp taxa caused significant reductions in sediment cover on rock substrata, reducing sedimentation and enhancing algal biovolume on clay tiles in cages.We evaluated the mechanism by which A. lanipes influences algae and benthic insects by comparing patterns of algal biomass, taxonomic composition and shrimp-presence treatments both with and without manual sediment removal. The shrimp exclusion treatment without manual sediment removal had significantly lower algal biomass and greater sedimentation than all other treatments. The treatment in which shrimp were excluded but sediment was manually removed, however, accrued almost the same algal biovolume as the shrimp enclosure treatment, supporting the hypothesis that sediment removal enhances the biovolume of understory algal taxa.  The effects of biotic (shrimp) and abiotic (discharge) factors on the depositional environment were quantified in a montane stream in Puerto Rico in a third experiment (LUQMetadataAS #106). Electricity was used experimentally to exclude large (approximately &amp;gt;1cm in length) biota without artificially increasing sedimentation as in cage enclosure/exclosure experiments in stream systems. Unelectrified control substrata had natural high densities of atyid shrimp. Atyid shrimp can significantly affect the accumulation of organic and inorganic materials on rock substrata in stream pools between high-discharge events.</literalLayout></para></abstract><funding><para><literalLayout>NSF</literalLayout></para></funding></project><access scope="document" order="allowFirst" authSystem="knb"><allow><principal>uid=LUQ,o=lter,dc=ecoinformatics,dc=org</principal><permission>all</permission></allow><allow><principal>public</principal><permission>read</permission></allow></access></dataset></eml:eml>
