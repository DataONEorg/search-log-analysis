      <abstract>Geomorphic mapping establishes the basic context for understanding modern channel conditions by (1) defining major elements of the late Cenozoic geologic history shaping the geomorphology of the study area; and (2) outlining the active geomorphic floodplain, which is the domain for assessing channel change and floodplain vegetation conditions. The mapping domain broadly corresponds with the extent of Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) topography acquired in November, 2004 (Watershed Sciences, 2005) and includes the broad alluvial valleys of the lower Sycan River, mainstem Sprague River, and lower North Fork of the Sprague River. The mapping encompasses the main floodplains and contiguous alluvial and colluvial landforms. The geomorphic mapping was based on aerial photographs, LiDAR topography acquired in November 2004 (Watershed Sciences, 2005), U.S. Geological Survey 7.5-minute topographic maps, existing soil mapping (Cahoon, 1985), prior geologic mapping (primarily Sherrod and Pickthorn, 1992), reconnaissance field observations, and stratigraphic sections, primarily along bank exposures but supplemented by augering.</abstract>
      <purpose>The overall objective of this study of the Sprague River basin is to provide understanding on (1) recent changes to the fluvial systems of the basin, (2) important geomorphic processes and conditions, and (3) their spatial variability and controls. The primary focus of our analysis was the 139 kilometers (km) of the mainstem Sprague River, the lower 16 km of the North Fork Sprague River, the lower 20 km of the South Fork Sprague River, and the lower 20 km of the Sycan River. Collectively, this part of the river network encompasses most of the low gradient reaches historically subject to agriculture and livestock grazing, as well as more recent channel restoration activities. Our analyses and findings were supported by (1) mapping and measurement of channel and floodplain features from historical maps and aerial photographs, and by high resolution LiDAR topography acquired in 2004, (2) stratigraphic measurements and analyses of floodplain deposits, (3) surveying the effects of 2006 high flows, and (4) geomorphic mapping based on soils, sedimentology and topography.</purpose>

            <edomv>Abandoned Fan</edomv>
            <edomvd>Incised tributary fan deposits, surfaces as much as 30 meters above active channels. These shallowly sloping (less than 10 degrees) alluvial transport surfaces have been incised because of base-level fall. Large abandoned fan complexes border the southern Sprague River valley in the Buttes of the Gods and Council Butte valley segments. Constriction of the valley by one such fan near the settlement of Sprague River separates these two valley segments. Locally, abandoned fan surfaces are enumerated 1 through 4 on the basis of increasing degree of incision (and presumably age). The older surfaces have only isolated remnants of original transport surfaces, underlain by fluvial gravel, separated younger (and lower) fan and tributary surfaces and by slopes formed in the underlying Tertiary lacustrine sediment. Some abandoned fan surfaces, such as those south of the Sprague River valley near Beatty and Bly, are partly formed of pumiceous pyroclastic flow deposits derived from Tertiary volcanic centers to the south (Sherrod and Pickthorn, 1992). Near the Sprague and Sycan rivers, these tributary fan deposits are locally interbedded with mainstem fluvial channel and overbank deposits. Primary soil taxonomic classes on abandoned fan surfaces include Haploxerolls, Argixerolls, and Durixerolls, indicating minor to significant accumulations of clays, silica, and carbonate. The ages of these surfaces likely range from Pliocene (almost certainly post-dating the ~3.0 Ma Basalt of Knot Tableland) to perhaps as young as early Holocene. The abandoned fans are largely stable features that contribute little sediment directly to the modern fluvial system. These abandoned alluvial fans reflect overall Tertiary and Quaternary valley incision of the Sprague River valley, probably in conjunction with integration and incision of the Sprague River through fault-uplifted canyon segments downstream.</edomvd>

            <edomv>Geomorphic Floodplain</edomv>
            <edomvd>Area of Holocene channel migration; channels and active floodplains along the North Fork Sprague, South Fork Sprague, mainstem Sprague, and Sycan rivers. This map unit, divided into valley segments, is the domain of the detailed mapping analysis of constructed features, historical channel change, and vegetation described reported by McDowell and others (2005) and O'Connor and others (2006). This unit encompasses the area of channels, abandoned channels, and bar-and-scroll topography evident on the 2004 LiDAR. The presence of mainstem channel topographic features distinguishes this unit from the Valley Fill unit. Soils are typically poorly drained and include volcanic-ash-rich Mollisols dominated by the Klamath-Ontko-Dilman series (Cahoon, 1985). Stratigraphy exposed on eroding streambanks and from augering show that these floodplain deposits almost everywhere formed after the 7.7 ka Mazama eruption. In places, particularly along the lower Sycan River (Lind, 2009) and the North Fork Sprague River, stratigraphic relations show at least two episodes of floodplain incision and filling in the last 7700 years. The geomorphic floodplain has formed in the last 7.7 ka from a combination of channel migration, channel avulsion, and lateral and vertical accretion of bedload and suspended load deposits. The geomorphic floodplain is mapped on the basis of morphology and does not necessarily correspond to a specific elevation above the channel or areas subject to flooding at a specific frequency. Locally includes springs and associated wetland deposits within the area of Holocene channel migration.</edomvd>

Six areas of springs and related features such as ponds, wetlands and channels are within the map area but outside of mainstem floodplains. Most are contiguous with the mainstem floodplain or flanking terraces. Spring outlets with flowing water have sandy to gravel substrates, surrounding saturated areas consisting chiefly of saturated peat deposits formed from aquatic vegetation. Most spring complexes are connected to the Sprague and Sycan rivers by sand-bed spring channels.</edomvd>

            <edomvd>Tributary channel, floodplain, and basin fill deposits in low-gradient areas subject to inundation, and unconfined by valley margins. Tributary channels and flanking surfaces grade to modern mainstem channels and floodplains, forming narrow and elongate map units extending into the uplands where channels become increasingly topographically confined. In some reaches, especially the Kamkaun Springs, the tributary valleys have very low, nearly horizontal, gradients, whereas in many locations, tributary valley floodplains have gradients approaching 5 degrees. The distinction with tributary fans and colluvium is primarily on the basis of plan-view morphology and slope but is locally indistinct. Primary soils on tributary floodplains are Inceptisols and Mollisols, which typically form in late Pleistocene or Holocene deposits (Soil Survey Staff, 1975).</edomvd>

Steep but smooth slopes, up to ~35 degrees, underlain by unconsolidated regolith and formed by gravitational and alluvial transport processes such as rockfall, avalanching, biogenic disturbance and sheet wash transport. Colluvial slopes typically head at steep bedrock outcrops, which are the source of material, and transition downslope to alluvial transport surfaces. Colluvium is locally an important source of coarse (gravel-size) material to the Sprague and Sycan rivers, especially in canyon segments where much of the floodplain is bordered by colluvium or bedrock. The distinction of colluvial slopes and active tributary fans is locally arbitrary, but tributary fans typically have slopes less than 10 degrees.</edomvd>

            <edomv>Mainstem Valley Fill</edomv>
            <edomvd>Floodplain and basin areas outside of active channel areas but historically subject to overbank flooding. Low-gradient planar surfaces totaling 28 km2 occupy broad areas flanking the Sprague River corridor, particularly in the Kamkaun Springs, S'choholis Canyon and Buttes of the God valley segments. Additionally, this map unit includes bottomlands flanking the post-Mazama zone of channel migration (the Active Mainstem Floodplain) in the Council Butte and Beatty-Sycan valley segments. The surfaces generally have soils mapped as Inceptisols or Mollisols formed in part by cumulic deposition of silt and clay during overbank flooding. Many of these surfaces are flooded during periods of high water, but show no evidence of hosting major channels. Many of these surfaces are now diked and drained. Some of these broad valley bottoms marginal to the main river course, especially within the Kamkaun Springs, S'choholis Canyon and Buttes of the God valley segments, appear to be long-term sediment depocenters as a consequence of overall Sprague River valley aggradation, perhaps in conjunction with block faulting along the North-Northwest trending faults transecting the lower part of the Sprague River valley. Within the Council Butte and Beatty-Sycan valley segments, the valley fill unit encompasses broad tracts of seasonally inundated lowlands flanking the Sprague River, but outside areas occupied by late Holocene channels. In places, this unit may correspond with low terraces mapped in the Council Buttes and Beatty Gap valley segments. The valley fill map unit everywhere represents areas of Holocene deposition during mainstem overbank flooding as well as from local runoff during seasonal high water.</edomvd>

            <edomv>Sycan Flood Deposits</edomv>
            <edomvd>A prominent planar surface extending south discontinuously from the lower Sycan River canyon to its confluence with the Sprague River. This surface stands 3 m above the active floodplain at the downstream end of Sycan Canyon, and descends to floodplain level near the Sycan River confluence with the Sprague River. It is underlain by as much as 3.35 m of bedded sand and gravel composed almost entirely of Mazama pumice. The deposits fine and thin downstream, where they are overlain by alternating beds of silty fine sand and sand. At their apex near the downstream end of the Sycan Canyon, these deposits grade to surfaces mantled with 1-m-diameter rounded basalt boulders, apparently derived from the canyon rim and walls and transported downstream. The soil capping these surfaces is mainly classified as an Ashy Typic Cryopsamment, indicating poorly developed soils formed in sandy parent materials. The pumiceous sand and gravel overlies organic-rich silt and clay deposits, locally peaty, and commonly containing within 10 cm of its top, a 0.5-to-2.5-cm-thick layer of silt- and sand-size Mazama tephra. This fallout tephra, constrained by radiocarbon dates here and in other areas resulted from the Mazama eruption of about 7.7 ka (Lind, 2009). We infer that this terrace resulted from a large, pumice-laden flood down the Sycan River within a few decades or centuries of the 7700 cal yr BP eruption (Lind, 2009). The close proximity of the base of the deposits to the unweathered Mazama fallout tephra indicates deposition was shortly after the eruption. A plausible source for such a flood was temporary impoundment of a lake in the Sycan Marsh area, possibly by dunes of Mazama pumice blocking the Sycan River channel near the marsh outlet (Lind, 2009). The Sycan flood deposits are coarse, loose, and erode readily from disturbed sites, particularly along tall banks flanking the modern channel or floodplain. In eroding areas, the Sycan flood terrace provides substantial sand-sized material to the lower Sycan River.</edomvd>

            <edomv>Terrace</edomv>
            <edomvd>Terrace deposits along mainstem Sprague River. Planar alluvial surfaces as high as 50 m above the active floodplain flank the Sprague River near its confluence with the Williamson River. Similarly, terraces at several elevations ranging up to 20 m above the active floodplain that border the Sprague River in the Chiloquin Canyon, Braymill, Kamkaun Spring, S'choholis Canyon, and Buttes of the Gods valley segments. Locally, terraces are enumerated 1 through 4 on the basis of increasing elevation (and presumably age) above geomorphic floodplain. Isolated low terraces flank the Sprague River in the Council Butte and Beatty Gap segments, as well as along the lower Sycan River. The terrace surfaces are underlain by fluvial gravel and are generally stable features upon which Haploxeroll soils have formed, indicating formation of a cambic B horizon and some carbonate accumulation (Soil Survey Staff, 1975). Terrace risers locally expose Tertiary lacustrine sediment or other bedrock units, indicating that at least some of the terraces are strath surfaces cut into the soft Tertiary sediment. The positions and degree of soil development are consistent with ages of late Tertiary through Quaternary. Many or all of these terraces pre-date the 7.7 ka Mazama eruption, judging from the presence of Mazama fall-out tephra in the upper parts of their soil profiles (Cahoon, 1985). Like the abandoned alluvial fans, the terraces result from episodic filling and incision during Quaternary downcutting of the Sprague River. Some of this downcutting may have resulted from broadscale base-level fall associated with integration of the upper Klamath River basin (Sherrod and Pickthorn, 1992), but some terrace sequences may reflect more local tectonic blockages associated with the north-northwest trending basin-and-range faulting affecting the western Sprague River valley segments.</edomvd>

    <overview>
      <eaover>The map units represent geomorphic surfaces including bedrock (undifferentiated), active and inactive alluvial fans, colluvial slopes, alluvial terraces, spring-complex areas, tributary and main-channel floodplains, and alluvial bottomlands. These landforms are mapped without specific regard to their constituent deposits, which makes this map slightly different than a typical geological map. This is especially the case for the terraces and inactive alluvial fans, which have been dissected by subsequent erosion, exposing underlying geologic units or producing narrow colluvial slopes along their margins, and leaving the main landforms with thin and locally discontinuous caps of alluvial gravel.</eaover>
