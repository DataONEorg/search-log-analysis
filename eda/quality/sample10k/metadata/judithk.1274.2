 <abstract><para>The size-grain hypothesis (SGH) maintains that as terrestrial walking organisms decrease in size, their realised environmental rugosity increases and becomes less planar. Therefore, it is hypothesised that the advantage of long limbs (i.e. increased efficiency of movement) may decrease in smaller organisms, where it is important that interstitial habitats can be effectively exploited using relatively shorter limbs. Positive allometric relationships between limb length and body size have been previously found in several ant taxa. We tested a corollary of the SGH by examining limbs in three taxa which were all capable of flight, hypothesizing that organisms in planar environments would have relatively longer limbs (either wings or legs) than organisms that utilise rugose environments. The lengths of bird and bat wings from differing habitats were obtained from the literature, and measurements of limb length, leg length, and pronotum width were taken from dung beetles caught in two different habitat types, one rugose, the other planar, in Skukuza, Kruger National Park. The strongest support for the SGH came from the bird taxa, where birds in a rugose environment (i.e. forest) had relatively shorter wings than birds from three planar environments (grassland, open coast and marine). Although there were signals of emerging support for SGH in bats, there were no significant trends present. It was proposed that this arose due to the use of forearm length as a proxy for wing size, and failed to capture total bat wing length and variability. Dung beetles also showed relatively little support for the SGH. Since dung beetles utilise two forms of locomotion, the trade-offs constraining their morphology are more complex than those that can be explained by the SGH.</para>

 <para>Study Sites</para>
 <para>The study took place in Skukuza, Kruger National Park, Mpumalanga Province, South Africa (24&#176;59&#8217; 45.66&#8221;S, 31&#176;35&#8217; 30.96&#8221;) during November 2009. Kruger National Park is located in northeastern lowveld of South Africa and is characterized by arid wooden savannas.  Skukuza&#8217;s subtropical climate allows a range of monthly averages temperatures from 5.6&#176; C to 32.6&#176; C. Vegetation structure can vary from open plains with sparse shrubs and tree canopy to closed forest areas along rivers.  Average rainfall for the park is about 530 mm per annum but ranges from 400 mm per annum to 730 per annum (Venter et al. 2003).  Skukuza is situated in the southeastern region of the park, and is comprised mainly of thorn thickets and riverine environments. Dung beetles were sampled in four sites; two rugose environments and two planar environments based on vegetation density. The planar sites were on a patch of grass near the Skukuza golf club, and on another patch of grass next to the cricket pitch.  These open areas were composed, short grasses and few large trees.  The rugose sites were composed much denser vegetation in thickets of broad-leaved forests on granite soils, typical of the Skukuza region of Kruger National Park near the Veterinary Camp.</para>
 <para>Dung Beetle Sampling</para>
 <para>At each of the four sites, three 20 cm diameter pitfall traps were placed at random and baited with warthog dung for two days and elephant dung for two days to sample dung beetles. The dung was suspended from a ground-level wire in cheesecloth over the pitfall. Traps were checked, emptied of insects and baited with fresh dung each morning during a four day study period.  Dung beetles were then separated into morpho-species groups by environment, and between five and fifteen individuals were used (depending on how many were available) to represent each group from each environment.  Any morpho-species for which less than five individuals were collected were not included in this study. For each representative individual, the pronotum width, femur length, tibia length, mesocoxal width, and wing length were measured using digital callipers.</para>
 <para>Leg measurements were added together to get a total leg length value, and this was regressed, along with wing length, with pronotum width (used as a proxy for body size).</para>
 <para>Bird Sampling Methods</para>
 <para>Data was extracted from the literature (Hockey et al 2005) for birds from four different southern African habitats. These habitats were forest, grassland, open coast and marine pelagic and were chosen in order to represent species from extremely differing habitats (with respect to rugosity). Lists of all the species can be found in appendices A-D.</para>
 <para>For each species the average wing length and body length were extracted and tabulated. The birds from the rugose forest environment were regressed separately against all the other birds from the remaining planar habitats. All birds that were included used the specific habitat as their primary environment according to the classification in Hockey et al. (2005).</para>
 <para>Certain species of birds were excluded from analyses due to specific characteristics of their non-avian locomotion that affected their wing shape. For example, in the grassland habitat, birds such as korhaans, storks, large herons and cranes were removed because they spend a lot of time moving around on the ground, and their wing measurements are therefore less relevant because these birds do not utilize the habitat in the same manner as most grassland birds. In the marine habitat, cormorants were removed because their wing measurements were seen as outliers, due to the fact that they are highly adapted for diving and swimming.</para>
 <para>Bat Sampling</para>
 <para>Insectivorous bats were researched in Bats of Southern Africa: a Biogeographic and Taxonomic Synthesis (Taylor, in press). Only bats with complete information on foraging type and mean measurements for male forearm length, total length and body mass were included. In order to achieve two discrete samples, open-foraging and clutter-foraging species were selected, while bats that forage on the edge of cluttered habitats and generalist species were not included.</para>
 <para>Data Analysis</para>
 <para>Dung beetle measurements were averaged by species in each environment, and regression analyses were performed testing the effect of pronotum width on wing length and total leg length (femur + tibia + tarsus + metatarsus). To test the environment&#8217;s effect on these characterists within a species, regression analysis of the same traits were also done comparing two small and two large species of dung beetle across environments. T-tests were performed to determine the significance of differences in the regression lines between environments.</para>
 <para>Similarly, bat forearm length was regressed against total body length in each environment. A Mann-Whitney U test was conducted to determine if body size differed between planar and rugose environments, and a t-tests was performed to test whether a significant difference in the relationship between forearm length and total body length existed across environments. Finally, bird wing length was regressed against body length in each environment, and t-tests were used to analyze the difference in slopes of the regression lines.</para>
 <para>All tests and regressions were performed in Microsoft Excel 2007.</para>
