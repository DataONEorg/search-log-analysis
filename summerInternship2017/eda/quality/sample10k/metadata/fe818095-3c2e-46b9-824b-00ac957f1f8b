purposes in Beckham, Custer, Roger Mills, and Washita Counties

      <supplinf>Introduction --

This data set consists of digitized polygons of constant
recharge rates for the Elk City aquifer in western Oklahoma.
The aquifer covers an area of approximately 193,000 acres and
supplies ground water for irrigation, domestic, and industrial
purposes in Beckham, Custer, Roger Mills, and Washita Counties
along the divide between the Washita and Red River basins
(Lyons, 1981).

The Elk City aquifer consists of the Elk City Sandstone and
overlying terrace deposits, made up of clay, silt, sand and
gravel, and dune sands in the eastern part and sand and gravel
of the Ogallala Formation (or High Plains aquifer) in the
western part of the aquifer (Lyons, 1981). The Elk City aquifer
is unconfined and composed of very friable sandstone, lightly
cemented with clay, calcite, gypsum, or iron oxide. Most of the
grains are fine-sized quartz but the grain size ranges from clay
to cobble in the aquifer (Lyons, 1981). The Doxey Shale
underlies the Elk City aquifer and acts as a confining unit,
restricting the downward movement of ground water.

The recharge polygon boundaries from the ground-water model
thesis, "A ground-water management model for the Elk City
aquifer in Washita, Beckham, Custer and Roger Mills Counties,
Oklahoma," by Lyons (1981, figs. 26 and 27) were transferred to
a photocopy of a paper map (plate 2) and digitized. The source
map was published at a scale of 1:63,360.

Recharge for the eastern part of the aquifer was calculated by
Lyons (1981) to be 14.1 percent of the annual precipitation
(27.80 inches) recorded at Clinton, Oklahoma, or 3.92 inches of
recharge per year. Recharge for the western part of the aquifer
was calculated by Lyons to be 14.1 percent of the annual
precipitation recorded (22.97 inches) at Sayre, Oklahoma, or
3.24 inches per year of recharge. The years used to calculating
the annual precipitation were not reported in the thesis.

Lyons (1981) used a quarter-mile grid for the ground-water flow
model and divided the aquifer into three subareas based on soil
type and topography. The subareas were assigned the recharge
rates 2.00, 3.92, or 4.00 inches per year. The subareas and
assigned recharge rates used in the ground-water model thesis
are used in this data set. These recharge rates also were used
by Kent, Lyons, and Witz (1982) in a ground-water model of the
Elk City aquifer.

Digital Line Graph (DLG) format requires numbers to be stored as
integers. Therefore, the recharge in inches per year was
multiplied by 100 and stored in the digital data sets as
hundredths of inches per year. For example 2.00 inches per year
was multiplied by 100 and stored in the digital data sets as 200
hundredths of an inch per year

Ground-water flow models are numerical representations that
simplify and aggregate natural systems. Models are not unique;
different combinations of aquifer characteristics may produce
similar results. The hydraulic conductivity and recharge are
closely interrelated. As long as these two model inputs are
in balance the model has a small mean residual; it represents
the natural system numerically. If the hydraulic conductivity is
accurately known, the model can be used to accurately determine
recharge. Likewise, if the hydraulic conductivity is poorly
known, then the recharge will be poorly determined.

Therefore, values of recharge used in the model and presented
in this data set are not precise, but are within a reasonable
range when compared to independently collected data. Recharge
probably varies considerably over the local area, and model
recharge is at best an average over an area at least as large
as the model grid (and probably much larger than a single
cell).

Reviews Applied to Data --

This electronic report was subjected to the same review standard
that applies to all U.S. Geological Survey reports. Reviewers
were asked to check the topological consistency, tolerances,
attribute frequencies and statistics, projection, and geographic
extent. Reviewers were given digital data sets and paper plots
for checking against the source maps to verify the linework and
attributes. The reviewers checked the metadata and a_readme.1st
files for completeness and accuracy.

Related Spatial and Tabular Data Sets --

This data set is one of four digital map data sets being published
together for this aquifer. The four data sets are:

&gt;              aqbound -  aquifer boundaries

&gt;              cond    -  hydraulic conductivity

&gt;              recharg -  aquifer recharge

&gt;              wlelev  -  water-level elevation contours

Digital map data sets of the Oklahoma surficial geology digitized from
1:250,000-scale maps (or 1:125,000-scale maps for the three Oklahoma
panhandle counties) are published separately.

    <useconst>This data set was digitized from a photocopy of map published at a
scale of 1:63,360, and represents the recharge polygons as reported
by Lyons (1981). Recharge polygons represented at this scale are
indicative of broad, regional trends and should not be interpreted
as site-specific. The recharge polygons were drawn onto and
digitized from a plate size, 29 inches by 39 inches, paper map,
with a root-mean-squared-error (RMSE) of 0.017 map inches (0.043
map centimeters) and 55.8 feet (17 meters) ground distance.

Ground-water flow models are numerical representations that
simplify and aggregate natural systems. Models are not unique;
different combinations of aquifer characteristics may produce
similar results. The hydraulic conductivity and recharge are
closely interrelated. As long as these two model inputs are
in balance the model has a small mean residual; it represents
the natural system numerically. If the hydraulic conductivity is
accurately known, the model can be used to accurately determine
recharge. Likewise, if the hydraulic conductivity is poorly
known, then the recharge will be poorly determined.

Therefore, values of recharge used in the model and presented
in this data set are not precise, but are within a reasonable
range when compared to independently collected data. Recharge
probably varies considerably over the local area, and model
recharge is at best an average over an area at least as large
as the model grid (and probably much larger than a single
cell).

    <overview>
      <eaover>Each polygon in this data set has an associated attribute, R,
containing values of recharge (Lyons, 1981) expressed in
hundredths of an inch per year. For example, the recharge value
of 2.00 inches per year is stored as an R value of 200. R is
stored in the first major code (MAJOR1) for polygons, and 0 is
stored in the first minor code (MINOR1) in the Digital Line
Graph (DLG) version of this data set.

Each line in this digital data set has an associated attribute,
LSOURCE, that contains a code to indicate the source of the
line. An LSOURCE code of 1 indicates the line was digitized from
Lyons (1981). LSOURCE is stored in the first major code (MAJOR1)
for lines, and 0 is stored in the first minor code (MINOR1) in
the Digital Line Graph (DLG) version of this data set.
