Coral trees are popular ornamental trees in Taiwan and some were found suffering wilt or die-back in southern Taiwan in 2003. The erythrina gall wasp was identified as the main cause of the damage and symptoms caused by the galler were described by Yang et al (2004). However, due to lack of control measures, the erythrina gall wasp has spread out all over the island since then, infesting and, in severe cases, killing tens of thousand coral trees. There are 8 species of coral tree, more than 40,000 trees infested in 2006 around Taiwan, more than hundred Erythrina varigata are killed.
  We proposed 6 chemical treatments to 120 infested coral trees in Kaohsiung Metropolitan Park to control the EGW.</para></abstract><keywordSet><keyword>EGW (erythrina gall wasp)</keyword><keyword>pesticide</keyword><keyword>chemical control</keyword></keywordSet><coverage scope="document"><geographicCoverage scope="document"><geographicDescription>Kaoshung Metropolitan Park</geographicDescription><boundingCoordinates><westBoundingCoordinate>119.625</westBoundingCoordinate><eastBoundingCoordinate>122.125</eastBoundingCoordinate><northBoundingCoordinate>25.25</northBoundingCoordinate><southBoundingCoordinate>22.375</southBoundingCoordinate></boundingCoordinates></geographicCoverage><temporalCoverage scope="document"><singleDateTime><calendarDate>2007</calendarDate></singleDateTime></temporalCoverage></coverage><contact scope="document"><references>1168592155837</references></contact><methods><methodStep><description><section><para>Two blocks, each contained 200 coral trees planted by KMP Administration, were chosen for the experiment. All these trees came from the same mother, with the same age of 9, and had been infested by EGW for at least 18 months prior to the experiment. The 2 blocks (block A and block B) were separated by a 5m-wide road. Sixty trees in each block were randomly chosen for experiment. All experimental trees in block A had been pollarded to remove all infested materials before the experiment. The 60 experimental trees in each block were further divided into 6 groups, each with 10 trees, for different treatments. Average height of the 120 experimental trees was 2.60 ± 0.74m and the average DBH was 10.7 ± 3.6cm.</para><para>The chemicals used in 6 treatments included: 1) Imidacloprid (Confidor, Bayer CropScience): a chloro nicotinyl systematic pesticide.  A total of 50g imidacloprid water soluble granule was applied to the base soil of each tree in treatment 1; 2) A 6.7 ml 9.6% imidacloprid solution was diluted 3000 X for spraying to trees of treatment 2; 3) Narrow range oil (Citrole, Total Finaelf): A 40ml mineral oil was diluted 500 X for spraying to trees of treatment 3; 4) Imidacloprid plus narrow range oil: A mixture of imidacloprid water suspension and narrow range oil (same concentration as in treatments 2 and 3, respectively) was used for spraying to trees of treatment 4; 5) Spinosad (Conserve, Dow AgroSciences): A 20 ml 11.6% solution was diluted 1000 X for spraying to trees of treatment 5; 6)Water: A total of 20 l water was sprayed to 10 trees of treatment 6 as control.</para></section></description></methodStep></methods><access authSystem="knb" order="denyFirst" scope="document"><allow><principal>public</principal><permission>read</permission></allow></access></dataset></eml:eml>
