 <abstract> <para>The aim of this study is to further test the relationship between innovation frequency and behavioral flexibility by directly measuring behavioral flexibility in great-tailed grackles (Quiscalus mexicanus) and compare their performance with previously tested New Caledonian crows (Corvus moneduloides; Logan et al. 2014) using most of the same experiments. Grackles are not innovative (n=1 innovation; Ducatez et al. 2014) and have an average relative brain size (Iwaniuk unpublished data), while New Caledonian crows are innovative (n=5 innovations, literature reviewed by Logan) and have large relative brain sizes (Iwaniuk unpublished data). Therefore, the prediction is that the less innovative and smaller brained grackles will show less behavioral flexibility than crows.

Grackles were given three experiments to investigate their problem solving abilities:

Experiment 1: Heavy vs. Light
A water tube was presented with 4 heavy (steel rod wrapped in fimo clay, weight=10g, each displaces 2-3mm of water) and 4 light (plastic tube partially filled with fimo clay, weight=2g, each displaces 1-1.5mm of water) objects placed in pseudorandomized (as explained for color learning) pairs near the top of the tube (both objects were 21-24mm long and 8mm in diameter; Figure 4). Heavy objects displaced 0.5-2mm more water than light objects, thus making them more functional than the light objects, but both objects were functional.

Experiment 2: Heavy vs. Light Magic
This is the same as experiment 1, except there are magnets (2 super magnets on the outside and 3 inside of the tube) attached to the tube above the water level such that the heavy objects stick to the magnets and do not displace water, while the light objects can fall past the magnets into the water, thus being the functional choice (Figure 5). Birds were given 3 heavy and 3 light objects, placed in pseudorandomized pairs near the top of the tube.

Experiment 3: Narrow vs. Wide Equal Water Levels
To determine whether birds understand volume differences, a wide and narrow tube with equal water levels are presented with four objects made out of fimo clay (30x10x5mm, 3-4g, each object displaces 1-2mm in wide tube and 5-6mm in narrow; Logan et al. 2014; Figure 6). Two objects were placed near the narrow tube opening and two objects were placed near the wide tube opening. The objects are only functional if dropped into the narrow tube because the water levels are set such that dropping all of the objects into the wide tube will not bring the floating food within reach. However, dropping 1-2 objects into the narrow tube will raise the water level enough to reach the food. Both tubes were 170mm tall with 3mm thick lids constricting the opening to 25mm in diameter to equalize the bird’s access to the inside of each tube, and super glued to a clear acrylic base (300x300x3mm). The wide tube (outer diameter=57mm, inner diameter=48mm, volume=307,625mm3) was roughly equally larger than the standard water tube (dimensions above, volume=192,800mm3) as the narrow tube was smaller (outer diameter=38mm, inner diameter=25mm, volume=83,449mm3). The tubes were pseudorandomized for side to ensure that tube choices were not based on a side bias.


Contrary to the prediction, grackles perform similarly to crows in experiments using clear tubes partially filled with water and containing a floating food reward, where objects must be dropped into the tube to raise the water level, bringing the food within reach. Grackles preferred to drop the more functional heavy (rather than light) objects (similar to crows) and some changed their preference in a follow up experiment where the heavy objects were no longer functional, thus exhibiting behavioral flexibility. However, unlike crows, grackles did not discriminate between two tubes with different water volumes. These results challenge the assumption that innovation measures behavioral flexibility since a non-innovative bird demonstrated behavioral flexibility at a level similar to innovative crows, and they challenge the assumption that only large brains are capable of behavioral flexibility because a bird with an average brain size solved problems similarly to large-brained crows.</para>

 <para>Eight wild adult great-tailed grackles (4 females and 4 males) were caught using a walk-in baited trap measuring 2ft high by 2ft wide by 4ft long (design from Overington et al. 2011). Birds were caught (and tested) in two batches: batch one at the Andree Clark Bird Refuge (4 birds in September 2014, released in December) and batch two at East Beach Park (4 birds in January 2015, released in March) in Santa Barbara, California. They were housed individually in aviaries measuring 72in high by 47in wide by 93 in long at the University of California Santa Barbara for 2-3 months while participating in the experiments in this study. Grackles were given water ad libitum and unrestricted amounts of food (Mazuri Small Bird Food, bread, and peanuts) for at least 20 hrs per day, with their main diet being removed for up to 4 hrs on testing days while they participated in experiments. Grackles were aged by plumage and eye color and sexed by plumage and weight following Pyle (2001). Biometrics, blood, and feathers were collected at the beginning and end of their time in the aviary. Their weights were measured at least once per month, first at the time of trapping using a balancing scale, and subsequently by placing a kitchen scale covered with food in their aviary and recording their weight when they jumped onto the scale to eat.</para>
