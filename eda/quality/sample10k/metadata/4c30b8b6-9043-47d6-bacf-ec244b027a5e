      <abstract>Surveys of the bathymetry and backscatter intensity of the sea floor south of Long Island, New York, were carried out in November 1998 using a Simrad EM1000 multibeam echosounder mounted on the Canadian Coast Guard ship Frederick G. Creed. The purpose of the multibeam echosounder surveys was to explore the bathymetry and backscatter intensity of the sea floor in several areas off the southern coast of Long Island along the 20-meter isobath. Survey areas offshore of Fire Island Inlet, Moriches Inlet, Shinnecock Inlet, and southwest of Montauk Point were about 1 kilometer (km) wide and 10 km long. The area was mapped by the U.S. Geological Survey with support from the Canadian Hydrographic Service and the University of New Brunswick.</abstract>
      <purpose>This data release makes the multibeam echosounder data from the 1998 survey of the sea floor offshore of Shinnecock Inlet, New York, available in digital form. The GeoTIFF image of shaded-relief bathymetry colored by backscatter intensity provides a visualization of both bathymetry and backscatter intensity. The shaded-relief image was created by vertically exaggerating the bathymetry 4 times and then artificially illuminating the relief by a light source positioned 45 degrees above the horizon from an azimuth of 60 degrees. The illumination from 60 degrees, approximately parallel to the survey lines, minimizes artifacts caused by small depth changes that may occur between lines. The backscatter intensity is represented by a suite of eight colors ranging from blue (low intensity) to green to yellow to red (high intensity).</purpose>
      <supplinf>Other data sets from this survey may be found in Butman and others (2016) (see larger work citation).</supplinf>

  <dataqual>
    <logic>Some features in the multibeam data are artifacts of data collection and environmental conditions.  They include small highs and lows and unnatural-looking features, and patterns oriented parallel or perpendicular to survey tracklines.  The orientation of the tracklines is sometimes identified by parallel stripes in the image.  During data acquisition, the electrically erasable programmable read only memory (EEPROM) within the transceiver that controls the beam launch angles was programmed with incorrect parameters for the outer ten beams on the port and starboard sides. This caused depth soundings to be deeper for these outer beams by approximately 0.1 m; these deeper soundings are not corrected. The Long Island surveys were assigned a block of line numbers beginning with 3000.</logic>
    <complete>This image contains edited bathymetry and backscatter intensity data collected in the 1998 Shinnecock Inlet multibeam survey.  There are a few gaps in the image due to incomplete coverage by the multibeam system. Other data sets collected offshore of Long Island, New York, on WHCMSC field activity 1998-015-FA may be found in Butman and others (2016) (see larger work citation).</complete>

        <srccontr>The multibeam data were collected with a Simrad EM1000 multibeam echosounder mounted on the starboard pontoon of the Canadian Coast Guard ship Frederick G. Creed. The multibeam system utilizes 60 electronically-aimed receive beams spaced at intervals of 2.5 degrees that insonify a strip of sea floor up to 7.5 times the water depth. The horizontal resolution of the beam on the sea floor is approximately 10 % of the water depth. Vertical resolution is approximately 1 % of the water depth. Data were collected along tracklines oriented approximately northeast-southwest, parallel to the local isobaths, and spaced about 100 m apart. The frequency of the sonar was 95 kHz. Sound velocity profiles were obtained and input into the Simrad processing system to correct for refraction. Navigation was by means of differential GPS. Operation of the Simrad EM1000 was carried out by hydrographers of the Canadian Hydrographic Service. The data were collected on Woods Hole Coastal and Marine Science Center field activity 1998-015-FA.</srccontr>

      <procstep>
        <procdesc>A suite of processing software (called SwathEd) (www.omg.unb.ca/~jhc/SwathEd.html), developed by the Ocean Mapping Group at the University of New Brunswick, Canada, was used to process and grid the multibeam bathymetric soundings and backscatter intensity data, and to produce images. The metadata for the bathymetry grid  (see link in larger work citation) describes the processing steps applied to the navigation and bathymetric soundings. The following processing steps produced the shaded-relief image of bathymetry colored by backscatter intensity for the Shinnecock data set:
1. Create a blank 8 bit map file:
Command line:  make_blank mosaic_file
This command commences a dialog to enable an 8 bit image and input the map boundaries and resolution .  The program also prompts for the projection type and parameters to be used creating the binary map file (custom Mercator projection, central longitude of -75 degrees, latitude of true scale 40 degrees north).   Then the "blank" file is copied to two files required by the mosaic program:
Command line:  cp mosaic_file.blank mosaic_file.mos
Command line:  cp mosaic_file.blank mosaic_file.ran
2.  Create backscatter files that can be then mosaicked from the backscatter time series:
Command line:  getBeamPattern filename (prefix only)
Command line:  makess -pixel 1.0 -beam_patt beampatt filename (prefix only) output.ss
Command line:  glfill output.ss output.ss_fill  (fills in data dropouts).
3.  Mosaic all the backscatter files created in the last step (for each output.ss_fill), and then use a two-point linear contrast stretch (0-254; 255 is no data) to enhance the backscatter image.
Command line:  mos2 -autoseam -maxazi 10 -maxdist 10 mosaic_file output.ss_fill
Command line:  stretchacres -low 170 -high 210 -in mosaic_file -out mosaic_file.stretch
4.  Create a shaded-relief image of the bathymetry using SwathEd routine addSUN (sun elevation of 45 degrees from 60, vertically exaggerating 4 times).
Command line:  addSUN -elev 45 -azi 60 -vert_exag 4.0 gridFile.r4 filename.shade
5.  Use a two-point linear contrast stretch (0-254; 255 is no data) to enhance the shaded-relief image:
Command line:  stretchacres -low 150 -high 200 -in filename.shade -out filename_shade.stretch
6. Create an image of shaded-relief bathymetry, colored by backscatter intensity:
Command line:  mix_ci -c mosaic_file.stretch -i filename_shade.stretch -m mosaic_file.pseudo</procdesc>

    <overview>
      <eaover>In this GeoTIFF image, the backscatter intensity is combined with the bathymetry to display the distribution of intensity in relation to the bathymetry. The backscatter intensity is represented by a suite of eight colors ranging from blue (low intensity) to green to yellow to red (high intensity). These data are draped over a shaded-relief image created by vertically exaggerating the topography four times and then artificially illuminating the relief by a light source positioned 45 degrees above the horizon from 60 degrees. The resulting image displays light and dark intensities within each color band that result from a feature's position with respect to the light source. For example, northeast-facing slopes, receiving strong illumination, show as a light intensity within a color band, whereas southwest-facing slopes, being in shadow, show as a dark intensity within a color band.  Image is 3-band, 24 bit R, G, B;  (255,255,255) is no data.</eaover>
