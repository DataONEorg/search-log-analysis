      <abstract>
This part of DS 781 presents data for the acoustic-backscatter map of Offshore of Scott Creek map area, California. Backscatter data are provided as three separate grids depending on mapping system. The raster data files are included in "BackscatterB_7125_OffshoreScottCreek.zip," which is accessible from http://dx.doi.org/10.5066/F7CJ8BJW.
The acoustic-backscatter map of the Offshore of Scott Creek, California was generated from backscatter data collected by California State University, Monterey Bay (CSUMB), by Fugro Pelagos, and by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). Mapping was completed between 2006 and 2009, using a combination of 400-kHz Reson 7125 and 244-kHz Reson 8101 multibeam echosounders, as well as a 234-kHz SWATHplus bathymetric sidescan-sonar system. Within the final imagery, brighter tones indicate higher backscatter intensity, and darker tones indicate lower backscatter intensity. The intensity represents a complex interaction between the acoustic pulse and the seafloor, as well as characteristics within the shallow subsurface, providing a general indication of seafloor texture and composition. Backscatter intensity depends on the acoustic source level; the frequency used to image the seafloor; the grazing angle; the composition and character of the seafloor, including grain size, water content, bulk density, and seafloor roughness; and some biological cover. Harder and rougher bottom types such as rocky outcrops or coarse sediment typically return stronger intensities (high backscatter, lighter tones), whereas softer bottom types such as fine sediment return weaker intensities (low backscatter, darker tones).</abstract>

        <procdesc>During the CSUMB and Fugro Pelagos mapping missions, an Applanix POS MV (Position and Orientation System for Marine Vessels) was used to accurately position the vessels during data collection, and it also accounted for vessel motion such as heave, pitch, and roll (position accuracy, ±2 m; pitch, roll, and heading accuracy, ±0.02°; heave accuracy, ±5%, or 5 cm). To account for tidal-cycle fluctuations, RTK data(GPS data with real-time kinematic corrections) was used; in addition, sound-velocity profiles were collected with an Applied Microsystems (AM) SVPlus sound velocimeter. Soundings were corrected for vessel motion using the Applanix POS MV data, for variations in water-column sound velocity using the AM SVPlus data, and for variations in water height (tides) using vertical-position data from the RTK receivers. Processing and mosaicking of Reson 7125 backscatter data were completed using GEOCODER Version 3.2 level 1 (created by Luciano Fonseca; Fugro Pelagos Modified Test Release 16). Within Geocoder, the backscatter intensities were radiometrically corrected (including despeckling and angle varying gain adjustments) and the position of each acoustic sample was geometrically corrected for slant-range and georeferenced to UTM Zone 10 N, WGS1984 datum. After the lines were imported, they were mosaicked into a 1m resolution image.  Overlap between parallel lines was resolved using a priority table based on the distance of each sample from the ship track, with samples closest to- and furthest from- the ship track given the lowest priority. An anti-aliasing algorithm was also applied.</procdesc>

    <techpreq>The downloadable data file has been compressed with the "zip" command and can be unzipped with Winzip (or other tool) on Windows systems. To utilize these data, the user must have software capable of uncompressing the WinZip file and importing and viewing an Esri ArcMap TIFF. Users should download the ArcGIS Project File, OffshoreScottCreekGIS.mxd.zip, a compressed (with the "zip" command) version of the ArcMap document (.mxd) that has all the data layers loaded in the table of contents for "Offshore Scott Creek" and has all the data symbolized as on the data release map sheets. Download and save this ArcGIS project file, including all data layers, to the directory the user has created for this GIS.</techpreq>
