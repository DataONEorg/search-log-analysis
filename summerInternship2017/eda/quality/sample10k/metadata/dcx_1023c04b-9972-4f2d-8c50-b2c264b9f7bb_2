They broadcasted position data into Summer/Fall 2008. The group drifted North to a maximum extent of just over 80 deg North, moved East and South to the maximum Eastern Extent of 231 degrees and continues south and then West ending 74 to 72 degrees North, considerably farther south than the deployment position.  ID#53536 loops around and moves westward to end almost back to the same longitude that it began but well South.

Buoys with ARGOS ID's 74353 thru 74364 were deployed as part of SEDNA campaign March 24, 2007 in two hexagonal patterns, one inside the other ~ 212 degrees East, 73 degrees North.  They drifted North West, then  North and finally North-East.  Most buoys fail before turning South but buoys ID#74360 and 74361 turn South with the former almost coming back to the deployment point in June 2009.  ID#74363 is the only other buoy to continue to report into 2009 and it remains on a North-East Track and does not loop South.  ID# 74358 is the first to fail in June 2007.  ID's  74355, 74359, 74362 and 74364 fail in Sept/Oct. 2007.  The rest are lost between Jun 2008 and October 2008.</dcterms:abstract><dcterms:spatial xsi:type="dcterms:Box">northlimit=80.2; southlimit=70.9; eastlimit=-129.; westlimit=-150.</dcterms:spatial><dcterms:temporal>Begin 2007-08-23T01:40:01.000000; End 2008-08-14T13:40:01.000000</dcterms:temporal></dcTerms></metadata>
