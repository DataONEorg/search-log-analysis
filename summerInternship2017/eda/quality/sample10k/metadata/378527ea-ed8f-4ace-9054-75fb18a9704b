      <abstract>This data set is a digital soil survey and generally is the most
detailed level of soil geographic data developed by the National
Cooperative Soil Survey. The information was prepared by digitizing
maps, by compiling information onto a planimetric correct base
and digitizing, or by revising digitized maps using remotely
sensed and other information.
		
This data set consists of georeferenced digital map data and
computerized attribute data. The map data are in a soil survey area
extent format and include a detailed, field verified inventory
of soils and miscellaneous areas that normally occur in a repeatable
pattern on the landscape and that can be cartographically shown at
the scale mapped. A special soil features layer (point and line
features) is optional. This layer displays the location of features
too small to delineate at the mapping scale, but they are large
enough and contrasting enough to significantly influence use and
management. The soil map units are linked to attributes in the
National Soil Information System relational database, which gives
the proportionate extent of the component soils and their properties.</abstract>
      <purpose>SSURGO depicts information about the kinds and distribution of
soils on the landscape. The soil map and data used in the SSURGO
product were prepared by soil scientists as part of the National
Cooperative Soil Survey.</purpose>
      <supplinf>Digital versions of hydrography, cultural features, and other
associated layers that are not part of the SSURGO data set may be
available from the primary organization listed in the Point of
Contact.</supplinf>

      <attraccr>Attribute accuracy is tested by manual
comparison of the source with hard copy plots and/or symbolized
display of the map data on an interactive computer graphic system.
Selected attributes that cannot be visually verified on plots or

addition, the attributes are tested against a master set of valid

    <logic>Certain node/geometry and topology GT- polygon/chain relationships
are collected or generated to satisfy topological requirements
(the GT-polygon corresponds to the soil delineation). Some of these
requirements include: chains must begin and end at nodes, chains
must connect to each other at nodes, chains do not extend through
nodes, left and right GT-polygons are defined for each chain
element and are consistent throughout, and the chains representing
the limits of the file are free of gaps. The tests of logical
consistency are performed using vendor software. All internal
polygons are tested for closure with vendor software and are checked
on hard copy plots. All data are checked for common soil lines (i.e.,
adjacent polygons with the same label). Edge locations generally do
not deviate from centerline to centerline by more than 0.01 inch.
The soil survey of Klamath County, Oregon, Southern Part, is joined
to the surveys of Crater Lake National Park, Oregon; Jackson County
area, Oregon, Parts of Jackson and Klamath Counties; Butte Valley-Tule
Lake Area, California, Parts of Siskiyou and Modoc Counties; and Modoc
National Forest Area, California. An acceptable join has been obtained.</logic>
    <complete>A map unit is a collection of areas defined and named in terms of
their soil components or miscellaneous areas or both. Each map
unit differs in some respect from all others in a survey area and
each map unit has a symbol that uniquely identifies the map unit
on a soil map. Each individual area, point, or line so identified
on the map is a delineation.
		
Soil Scientists identify small areas of soils or miscellaneous areas
that have properties and behavior significantly different than the
named soils in the surrounding map unit. These minor components
may be indicated as special features. If they have a minimal effect
on use and management, or could not be precisely located, they may
not be indicated on the map.
		
A map unit has specified kinds of soils or miscellaneous areas
(map unit components), each with a designated range in
proportionate extent. Map units include one or more kinds of soil
or miscellaneous area. Miscellaneous areas are areas that have little
or no recognizable soil.
		
Specific National Cooperative Soil Survey standards and procedures
were used in the classification of soils, design and name of map
units, and location of special soil features. These standards are
outlined in Agricultural Handbook 18, Soil Survey Manual, 1993,
USDA, NRCS; Agricultural Handbook 436, Soil Taxonomy, 1995,
USDA, NRCS; and all Amendments; Keys to Soil Taxonomy,
(current issue) USDA, NRCS; National Soil Survey
Handbook, title 430-VI,(current issue) USDA, NRCS.
		
The actual composition and interpretive purity of the map unit
delineations were based on data collected by scientists during
the course of preparing the soil maps. Adherence to National
Cooperative Soil Survey standards and procedures is based on
peer review, quality control, and quality assurance. Quality
control is outlined in the memorandum of understanding for the
soil survey area and in documents that reside with the Natural
Resources Conservation Service state soil scientist. Four kinds
of map units are used in soil surveys: consociations, complexes,
associations, and undifferentiated groups.
		
Consociations - Consociations are named for the dominant soil.
In a consociation, delineated areas use a single name from the
dominant component in the map unit. Dissimilar components are
minor in extent. The soil component in a consociation may be
identified at any taxonomic level. Soil series is the lowest
taxonomic level. A consociation that is named as a miscellaneous
area is dominantly that kind of area and minor components do not
significantly affect the use of the map unit. The total amount of
dissimilar inclusions of other components in a map unit generally
does not exceed about 15 percent if limiting and 25 percent if
nonlimiting. A single component of a dissimilar limiting inclusion
generally does not exceed 10 percent if very contrasting.
		
Complexes and associations - Complexes and associations consist
of two or more  dissimilar components that occur in a regularly
repeating pattern. The total amount of other dissimilar components
is minor extent. The following arbitrary rule determines whether
complex or association is used in the name. The major components
of an association can be separated at the scale of mapping. In
either case, because the major components are sufficiently different
in morphology or behavior, the map unit cannot be called a
consociation. In each delineation of a complex or an association,
each major component is normally present though their proportions
may vary appreciably from one delineation to another. The total
amount of inclusions in a map unit that are dissimilar to any of
the major components does not exceed 15 percent if limiting and
25 percent if nonlimiting. A single kind of dissimilar limiting
inclusion usually does not exceed 10 percent.
		
Undifferentiated groups - Undifferentiated groups consist of two
or more components that are not consistently associated
geographically and, therefore, do not always occur together in
the same map delineation. These components are included in the
same named map unit because their use and management are the same
or very similar for common uses. Generally they are grouped together
because some common feature, such as steepness, stoniness, or
flooding, determines their use and management. If two or more
additional map units would serve no useful purpose, they may be
included in the same unit. Each delineation has at least one of the
major components, and some may have all of them. The same principles
regarding the proportion of minor components that apply to
consociations also apply to undifferentiated groups. The same
principles regarding proportion of inclusion apply to
undifferentiated groups as to consociations.
		
Minimum documentation consists of three complete soil profile
descriptions that are collected for each soil added to the legend,
one additional per 3,000 acres mapped; three 10 observation
transects for each map unit, one additional 10 point transect per
3,000 acres.
		
A defined standard or level of confidence in the interpretive
purity of the map unit delineations is attained by adjusting the
kind and intensity of field investigations. Field investigations
and data collection are carried out in sufficient detail to name
map units and to identify accurately and consistently areas of
about 5 acres.</complete>
    <posacc>
      <horizpa>
        <horizpar>The accuracy of these digital data is based upon their
compilation to base maps that meet National Map
Accuracy Standards at a scale of 1 inch equals 1,000
feet. The difference in positional accuracy between the
soil boundaries and special soil features locations in the
field and their digitized map locations is unknown. The
locational accuracy of soil delineations on the ground varies
with the transition between map units.
		
For example, on long gently sloping landscapes the transition
occurs gradually over many feet. Where landscapes change
abruptly from steep to level, the transition will be very
narrow. Soil delineation boundaries and special soil features
generally were digitized within 0.01 inch of their locations on
the digitizing source. The digital map elements are edge matched
between data sets. The data along each quadrangle edge are
matched against the data for the adjacent quadrangle. Edge
locations generally do not deviate from centerline to centerline
by more than 0.01 inch.</horizpar>

        <procdesc>Publication film positives were made from the publication film
negatives.  Digitizing was completed by contract administered by the
NRCS, National Cartography and Geospatial Center in Fort Worth, Texas.
Area delineations and special soil features were manually digitized
from publication film positives, in North American Datum of 1927.
The data were then merged into full 7.5 minute quadrangles.  The data
were formatted in DLG-3 Optional using PC ARC. The digitizing was
verified by the National Cartography and Geospatial Center (NCGC)
for conformity to specifications prior to final contract approval and
released to the state for author error corrections.  Author error
corrections were resolved by the state soil scientist and indicated
on check plots which were submitted to the NCGC for use in correcting
the digital data.  Digital corrections were made using ARC/INFO
7.0.4.  The data were written to DLG-3 Optional format using
ARC/INFO 7.0.4.</procdesc>

SSURGO data of Klamath County, Oregon, Southern Part were imported
to ARC/INFO, Version 8.0 by Natural Resources Conservation Service
soil scientist in Tangent, Oregon.  ARC/INFO exchange files were
projected to Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM), North American
Datum of 1983.  ARCEDIT was used to adjust soil delineations along
water areas in order to fit current imagery.  Small water bodies
less than 5 acres were considered for removal.  Compilation review
of the county wide ARC/INFO EXCHANGE files were completed by
soil scientists at the state office in Portland, Oregon.  NAD83,
7.5 minute quadrangle grid was used to intersect the county wide
coverage.  Quadrangles were then reselected for the survey area.
Quality control routines were completed on all quadrangles for area
and special feature coverages.  ARCEDIT was used to correct label
errors and node mismatches.  Digital Line Graph Optional, (DLG-3)
files were written.</procdesc>

    <overview>
      <eaover>Map Unit Delineations are closed polygons that may be dominated
by a single soil or miscellaneous area component plus allowable
similar or dissimilar soils, or they can be geographic mixtures
of groups of soils or soils and miscellaneous areas.
		
The map unit symbol uniquely identifies each closed map unit
delineation. Each symbol corresponds to a map unit name. The
map unit key is used to link to information in the National
Soil Information System tables.
		
Map Unit Delineations are described by the National Soil
Information System database. This attribute database gives the
proportionate extent of the component soils and the properties for
each soil. The database contains both estimated and measured data
on the physical and chemical soil properties and soil
interpretations for engineering, water management, recreation,
agronomic, woodland, range, and wildlife uses of the soil.
		
The National Soil Information System database contains static
metadata. It documents the data structure and includes such
information as what tables, columns, indexes, and relationships
are defined as well as a variety of attributes of each of these
database objects. Attributes include table and column
descriptions and detailed domain information.
		
The National Soil Information System database also contains a
distribution metadata. It records the criteria used for selecting
map units and components for inclusion in the set of distributed
data.
		
Special features are described in the feature table.  It includes an
area symbol, feature label, feature name, and feature description for
each special and ad hoc feature in the survey area.
		
The attributes "Root_mn_in", "Root_mx_in", and "Root_av_in" refer to the plant rooting depth for each soil type.  
Root_mn_in:  Minimum value (in inches) of the range of rooting depth reported in the descriptions of each individual soil map unit or as 60 inches for soils with rooting depths reported as greater than 60 inches. 
Root_mx_in:  Maximum value (in inches) of the range of rooting depth reported in the descriptions of each individual soil map unit or as 60 inches for soils with rooting depths reported as greater than 60 inches. 
Root_av_in:  Average value (calculated as the mean) (in inches) of the range of rooting depths reported in the descriptions of each individual soil map unit or as 60 inches for soils with rooting depths reported as greater than 60 inches. 
Please note that for each depth to water table attribute, values of "0" should be interpreted as "NULL".
Values for soil rooting depths were obtained from the individual soil descriptions reported in Soil Survey of Klamath County, Oregon, Southern Part (NRCS1) for all soils except for soil map units 30, 106, 107, and 108 which were obtained from the Soil  Survey Geographic (SSURGO) database (NRCS5). No value was provided from either source for soil map unit 85, 93B, 94E, 95B, 96B, 97F, 98E, 99B, 100, 101, 102, 103C, 104, 105, DAM, or W (water) and rooting depth values for these units have been left blank.  Where blank values occur, the value of the attribute is equal to "0". Values of soil rooting depth reported in these sources are presented either as a range between a minimum and maximum depth, in inches, or as "greater than 60 inches."  For soils map units that are composed of two soil types, each with individually specified rooting depths, the soil rooting depth attributes reported here were weighted by the proportion of the areal extent covered by each soil type.</eaover>
