      <supplinf>Introduction --

This data set consists of digital water-level elevation contours
for the Quaternary alluvial and terrace deposits along the
Beaver-North Canadian River from the panhandle to Canton Lake in
northwestern Oklahoma in 1977 and 1978. Ground water in 830
square miles of Quaternary-age alluvial and terrace aquifer
is an important source of water for irrigation, industrial,
municipal, stock, and domestic supplies. The aquifer consists of
poorly sorted, fine to coarse, unconsolidated quartz sand with
minor amounts of clay, silt, and basal gravel. The hydraulically
connected alluvial and terrace deposits unconformably overlie
the Tertiary-age Ogallala Formation and Permian-age formations
(Davis and Christenson, 1981).

In this report, elevation refers to distance above sea level and
sea level refers to the National Gedodetic Vertical Datum of
1929 (NGVD29)--a geodetic datum derived from a general
adjustment of the first-order level nets of both the United
States and Canada, formerly called Sea Level Datum of 1929. The
water-level elevations measured in 1977 and 1978 ranged from
2,260 feet above sea level in the northwest to 1,620 feet above
sea level in the southwest. Regional ground-water flow is
generally southwest towards the Beaver-North Canadian River. An
exception is in the northwest part of the aquifer where
ground-water flow direction is northeast because of downward
leakage into the Permian formations. The contour interval is 20
feet (Davis and Christenson, 1981).

The water-level elevation contours were digitized from a folded
paper map in the U.S. Geological Survey publication,
"Geohydrology and numerical simulation of the alluvium and
terrace aquifer along the Beaver-North Canadian River from the
Panhandle to Canton Lake, northwestern Oklahoma," by Davis and
Christenson (1981, plate 3). The source map was published at a
scale of 1:250,000.

Reviews Applied to Data --

This electronic report was subjected to the same review standard
that applies to all U.S. Geological Survey reports. Reviewers
were asked to check the topological consistency, tolerances,
attribute frequencies and statistics, projection, and geographic
extent. Reviewers were given digital data sets and paper plots
for checking against the source maps to verify the linework and
attributes. The reviewers checked the metadata and a_readme.1st
files for completeness and accuracy.

Related Spatial and Tabular Data Sets --

This data set is one of four digital map data sets being published
together for this aquifer. The four data sets are:

&gt;              aqbound -  aquifer boundaries

&gt;              cond    -  hydraulic conductivity

&gt;              recharg -  aquifer recharge

&gt;              wlelev  -  water-level elevation contours

Digital map data sets of the Oklahoma surficial geology
digitized from 1:250,000-scale maps (or 1:125,000-scale maps for
the three Oklahoma panhandle counties) are published separately.

    <useconst>The source map from which this data set was digitized was
published at a scale of 1:250,000, and represents the elevation of
the water levels in the alluvial and terrace deposits along the
Beaver-North Canadian River from the panhandle to Canton Lake
Oklahoma, in 1977-78 (Davis and Christenson, 1981, plate 3). Water
levels represented at this scale are indicative of broad, regional
trends and should not be interpreted as site specific. The
contours were digitized from a folded paper map (30 inches by
22 inches), with a maximum registration root-mean-squared-error
(RMSE) of 0.017 map inches (0.043 map centimeters) or 354.0 feet
(107.90 meters) ground distance.

        <procdesc>The water-level contours were digitized in three sessions with
a maximum registration root-mean-squared error (RMSE) of 0.017
inches (0.043 centimeters) map distance or 354.0 feet (107.90
meters) ground distance. Universal Transverse Mercator-Zone 14
was the projection used for digitizing.

        <procdesc>The data set was edited to delete extraneous pseudo and dangle
nodes. The ARC/INFO CLEAN command (ESRI, 1995), was used with
a dangle length of 3,280.0 feet (1,000.0 meters) and fuzzy
tolerance of 328.0 feet (100.0 meters).

        <procdesc>The registration tics used in the initial digitizing were
township and range corners taken form 1:24,000-scale
topographic maps. A comparison of a paper plot of the data set
with the source map showed that the township and range corners
were not in the same locations on the 1:250,000-scale source
map. To correct the problem a 1:250,000-scale U.S. Geological
Survey quadrangle map was registered using latitudinal and
longitudinal registration tics, with a maximum
root-mean-squared-error (RMSE) of 0.003 inches (0.007
centimeters) map distance or 72.97 feet (22.24 meters) ground
distance. Ten registration tics were selected and digitized
from the quadrangle map, and given the same tic identification
numbers as the tics that were used initially. These new tics
were used with the ARC/INFO TRANSFORM command (ESRI, 1995) to
adjust the digitized lines to more closely match the source
map. The registration root-mean-squared-error (RMSE) for
TRANSFORM was 403.90 feet (123.11 meters) ground distance or
0.019 map inches (0.048 map centimeters).

        <procdesc>Attribute codes were added to the digitized water-level data
set. Verification of attribute codes were made by comparing a

PROJECT command (ESRI, 1995) was used to convert the report
data set projection from Universal Transverse Mercator-Zone 14
to Albers Conical Equal Area.

    <overview>
      <eaover>Two attributes are associated with each line in this digital
data set. The first attribute, ELEV, contains the elevation of
the water-level contour, expressed in feet above the National
Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 (NGVD29). The second attribute,
LTYPE, contains a code indicating the line is solid (1) or
dashed (2) on the source map. ELEV is stored in the first major
code (MAJOR1) for the line, and LTYPE is stored in the first
minor code (MINOR1) in the Digital Line Graph (DLG) version of
this data set.
