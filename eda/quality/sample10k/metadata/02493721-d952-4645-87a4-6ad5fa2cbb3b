      <abstract>This digital geospatial data set contains the locations, values, and uncertainties of 700 hydraulic-head observations used in the steady-state, prepumped period of the transient model of the Death Valley regional ground-water flow system (DVRFS), a 100,000-square-kilometer region of southern Nevada and California. Hydraulic-head observations, which are the composite of one or more water-level measurements made at a well, are used to calibrate ground-water flow models. To develop hydraulic-head observations for the DVRFS ground-water flow model, nearly all available water levels for the DVRFS region through 2004 were compiled in Ground-Water Site Inventory (GWSI), the ground-water component of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) National Water Information System (NWIS) database. Water levels suitable for developing hydraulic-head observations representative of regional, steady-state ground-water flow conditions were identified through analyses. The resulting water levels were averaged for each well to produce one hydraulic-head observation value at each of 700 wells. The uncertainty of each hydraulic-head observation was statistically quantified from the values of uncertainties associated with well altitude and location, nonsimulated transient stress, and measurement accuracy.</abstract>
      <purpose>The hydraulic-head observations and associated uncertainties in this data set represent regional, steady-state (not affected by pumping) ground-water conditions  in the DVRFS transient ground-water flow model. Head observations and their uncertainties are an input file to MODFLOW-2000, the USGS 3D finite-difference code used to simulate ground-water flow in the DVRFS.</purpose>
      <supplinf>The steady-state, hydraulic-head observation data set is one of many layers in a geospatial database supporting the USGS DVRFS project. During this 5-year (1998-2004) project the USGS, in cooperation with DOE and other Federal, State, and local agencies, developed this geospatial database for a regional-scale, 3D hydrogeologic framework model (HFM) and a ground-water flow model. The models are intended to address water-resource issues and the potential movement of radioactive material from the Nevada Test Site and the proposed high-level nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain, Nevada.

Data from two previous ground-water flow models of the greater Death Valley region (see "Larger Work Citation", Chapter A, p. 7) were the foundation of the DVRFS geospatial database. Those and other data were reexamined through a series of regional-scale hydrologic investigations to provide updated and spatially consistent interpretations for the DVRFS study. In some cases, new data were collected to augment the existing information. Data compiled from the studies include natural ground-water discharge occurring through evapotranspiration and spring flow; ground-water pumping for the period 1913-98; ground-water recharge simulated as net infiltration; ground-water inflow and outflow at lateral model boundaries; hydraulic conductivity and its relation to depth and other rock properties; and the estimation of water levels representative of prepumped and pumped conditions in the region. Digital elevation models, geologic maps, borehole information, cross sections, and other 3D models were used to develop the HFM which represents the geometry of 27 hydrogeologic units and structural features. The resulting geospatial database supports characterization and conceptualization of the DVRFS, construction of 3D hydrogeologic framework and ground-water flow models, and visualization of analysis and model results.</supplinf>

      <attraccr>Attributes in this data set were derived either from the USGS GWSI database or the data set author (Point of Contact). The transfer of attributes from the USGS GWSI database was validated through manual comparison and cross checking. The accuracy of GWSI attribute information is indicated by accuracy codes which reflect the accuracy of the original source. Attributes added by the data set author were checked routinely by inspection using queries, hardcopy printouts, and visually using a GIS. In addition, attributes were checked and evaluated as part of the review process associated with the publication of the source report (Larger Work Citation).</attraccr>

    <logic>Points represent real-world well locations. Coincident points represent the locations of multiple piezometers in a single well, multiple completions within a single well, or a well that has been recompleted to a new depth.</logic>
    <complete>All accessible water-level and well-completion data through 2004 for the region were obtained from Nye County, Nevada; the States of Nevada and California; U.S. Geological Survey (USGS); National Park Service; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service; Department of Energy Yucca Mountain Project and Underground Test Area Program; and local mining operations. The resulting compilation of nearly 40,000 water-level measurements in about 2,100 wells was transferred to the USGS GWSI database. Temporal and spatial gaps in the water-level data were addressed by making additional field measurements or by compiling previously omitted measurements. Analyses to assess the suitability of measurements for developing regional, steady-state head observations for the DVRFS flow model reduced the data set to about 12,000 water levels in 700 wells.Wells having insufficient information for determining an open interval were omitted. The water levels suitable for estimating steady-state (not affected by pumping) head observations at each well were averaged to produce one hydraulic-head observation value at each of the 700 observation wells represented in this data set.</complete>

      <horizpa>
        <horizpar>The accuracy of a well location is indicated by the coordinate accuracy code reported in GWSI. Coordinate accuracy codes vary according to methods used to locate a well. Latitude and longitude coordinate accuracy codes given in GWSI for wells in the DVRFS region typically range from about 0.1 to 100 seconds. Higher accuracy is associated with high-precision surveying methods, such as spirit level or differential global positioning system (GPS) surveying; and lower accuracy with coordinates determined solely on the basis of a given map.</horizpar>
      </horizpa>
      <vertacc>
        <vertaccr>The accuracy of land-surface altitude at a well location is indicated by the altitude accuracy code reported in GWSI. Altitude accuracy codes are expressed as a plus/minus (±) range related directly to the method by which the altitude was determined. Ranges vary from about ±0.03 m for high-precision methods, such as spirit level and GPS surveying, to about ±25 m for estimates determined from topographic maps having large (50 m) contour intervals.</vertaccr>

        <procdesc>SQL queries were used to extract all water-level and well-completion information for the DVRFS study area through August 10, 2004 from the USGS GWSI database. The resulting data set of nearly 40,000 water levels measured in about 2,100 wells was stored in an intermediate Microsoft Access project database. Wells having insufficient information for determining an open interval were omitted. Each water-level measurement was assigned attributes to assess its suitability for developing hydraulic-head observations that were representative of regional, steady-state conditions. These attributes were determined by analyzing hydrographs, reviewing reports, and evaluating the well location relative to centers of pumping and underground nuclear tests. Open-interval depth information for wells also was evaluated to assess whether measured fluctuations result from precipitation variations or evapotranspiration. About 12,000 water levels in 700 wells were attributed as appropriate for use in developing regional, steady-state hydraulic-head observations. The head observation was computed as the average of all regional, steady-state water levels at each well. Values of errors for the well location and altitude, nonsimulated transient stress, and water-level measurement methods were used to statistically quantify the value of uncertainty for each hydraulic-head observation. The average water levels, uncertainty values, and attribute information required to construct a MODFLOW-2000 input file were transferred from the intermediate Microsoft Access database to a GIS (ArcMap) to create this digital data set.</procdesc>
