        <abstract>The project systematically surveys the extent and condition of remnant native vegetation on railway corridors / roadsides . A standard drive-by survey methodology is used to record dominant species (overstorey, understorey, emergent, threatened and alien species), structural type, density/distribution and understorey vegetation type in roadside vegetation. Mapping outputs are used to inform roadside vegetation management by Local and State Governments.

                <description>Study Location Visit Method: To systematically survey the structure, dominant species and condition of roadside vegetation using a 'drive-by' method. In AEKOS a Study Location Visit within a Roadside Vegetation Survey is defined as the sampling of a whole road completed within one day, or a definable section of a long road completed in one day (as identified by clear landmarks such as road intersections).The study locations visited on a particular day are generally selected with the objective of minimising the time spent travelling between study locations. To conduct the 'drive-by' component of the survey, the main equipment will be required is a motor vehicle with an  accurate odometer (preferably with a tripmeter facility). Although any vehicle can be used to conduct the 'drive-by' survey, data collection is easiest in a vehicle that maximises the view of the roadside vegetation. High clearance 4-wheel drive vehicles are preferred as they provide a more elevated viewing position than conventional vehicles. Other main items include the field datasheets (http://www.environment.sa.gov.au/files/3e40bcf1-b7ef-4e00-a016-9e30011890a5/roadside_veg_survey.pdf) and topographic mapsheets for recording key landmarks as calibration points (see calibration point method).; Road Calibration Method: To align odometer based measurements of road vegetation segments with GIS representations of the road section (a stretch of road between two intersections). During fieldwork, the odometer of the survey vehicle will be used to measure distances between identified road and vegetation features. Variations in altitude of the road surface result in a difference between the road distance travelled and the distance measured along a GIS digital representation of the road network (see Figure 1 below). This difference is calibrated using multiple GPS readings of obvious map features (calibration points) to ensure that the distance travelled on the ground and the GIS road network layer features align with each other. The recording of a calibration point is triggered when arriving at start and end points of roads, road intersections and other permanent road features that are visible on topographic maps. Approximately 5-10 calibration points are collected per 20 km of road. Situations that require particular attention are hilly areas and long road lengths. Even short road lengths have calibration points.; Road Segment Identification Method :Each visited road (study location visit) is travelled as a single transect during which roadside vegetation is divided into segments based on changes in species composition, condition and structure. Roads and associated roadside vegetation are divided into segments to map changes in species composition, condition and structure. Distance readings from the car's tripmeter (or odometer) are used to define the start and end points of segments, and this information is used by the mapping process to spatially display segments. New segments are primarily defined by a change in the vegetation type. This will usually involve a complete change in the dominant / co-dominant overstorey species, although it may occasionally involve a substantial shift in the relative abundance of two or three co-dominant overstorey species (particularly with mallee eucalypts), or a substantial change in the dominant / co-dominant understorey species. Avoid changing segments regularly in response to minor variations in relative abundance as this will usually contribute little valuable data while complicating the analysis after field work. A new segment must to be started when a threatened species appears or disappears.; Vegetation Assessment Method : To record the structure, dominant species and condition of roadside vegetation segments using a 'drive-by' method. There are four components to the description of the vegetation: structural type, density/distribution and understorey type and condition. The majority of this data can be obtained from a moving vehicle, but particular observations of vegetation segments may require the observers to stop and exit the vehicle for a closer look at a plant or to collect a voucher specimen. Boundaries of vegetation segments are defined by major changes in species composition and structure, or by other significant changes (see Road Segment Assessment Method). If the roadside vegetation segment is infected by Phytophthora (dieback), the severity and affected species are recorded.; Vegetation Species Assessment Method: To record the dominant overstorey, understorey, emergent, alien and threatened species for each surveyed roadside vegetation segment. Dominant overstorey, understorey, emergent, alien and threatened species are recorded for each surveyed roadside vegetation segment. Segments are defined by major shifts in vegetation structure and species composition. Taxa that are well known to the field botanist do not have specimens collected, but where field identification is uncertain specimens are collected to allow the identification by expert plant determiners (State Herbarium of SA). Plant Taxonomy follows the Census of SA Plants published by the State Herbarium of SA.; Vegetation Segment Significance Analysis: To analyse the species composition of roadside vegetation segments and define the major vegetation associations represented in the survey area. Based on the conservation priority rating of these associations and the condition of each segment an overall significance rating is applied to each vegetation segment. The dominant species, structural type and understorey data are used to define a vegetation association for each segment. Each association is assigned a priority rating of relative conservation significance. A vegetation association is defined for this methodology as an array of plant species 'of which the dominant stratum has a qualitatively uniform floristic composition and which exhibits a uniform structure as a whole' (Beadle and Costin 1952). Each association has a description which typically  includes one or more characteristic species that are dominant in the overstorey, and a structural description. Some associations may also include  understorey information if this is characteristic of the association type. For example, segments that have Eucalyptus leucoxylon and E. camaldulensis as dominant species, with woodland as the structural type and 'GN' (native grasses) as an understorey type may be assigned to a vegetation association described as 'E. leucoxylon / E. camaldulensis Woodland with grassy understorey'. Because many combinations of dominant species, structural type and understorey will be repeated in more than one segment, the analysis is performed using a list (produced by BDBSA) of the unique combinations of these attributes. This means that the analysis does not involve working through the entire dataset to enter an association for each individual segment. An association name is entered for each unique combination, and this is automatically linked back to the main data so that all segments with the same combination are assigned the same association name and conservation priority rating. The overall significance of each roadside segment is determined by combining the conservation significance and assessed condition. The overall significance rating provides a simple summary of the relative conservation significance of the vegetation in each segment.</description>
