      <abstract>This dataset describes wells and test holes completed in the
Madison Limestone that were used to create the
structure-contours for the top of the Madison Limestone, Black
Hills, South Dakota.
			</abstract>
      <purpose>Data on wells and test holes in this data set were used to
identify elevations for the top of the Madison Limestone for
the creation of a structure-contour map. This data set was
created as part of the Black Hills Hydrology Study (BHHS). The
BHHS is a long-term investigation that was initiated in 1990
as a cooperative effort between the U.S. Geological Survey
(USGS), the South Dakota Department of Environment and Natural
Resources (DENR), and the West Dakota Water Development
District. West Dakota represents various local and county
cooperators. The purpose of the study is to assess the
quantity, quality, and distribution of surface and ground
water in the Black Hills area of western South Dakota
(Driscoll, 1992). The study area includes parts of Butte,
Custer, Fall River, Lawrence, Meade, and Pennington counties
in South Dakota.
			</purpose>
      <supplinf>Process steps:
Well construction, well location, and related data were
retrieved from drilling records kept on file in the Rapid
City, South Dakota, U.S. Geological Survey office. Wells were
eliminated from the list if no geologic log was
available. Values of latitude, longitude, and elevations of
formation tops for wells were used as input to ARC/INFO to
create a point coverage of these wells.

Reviews_Applied_to_Data:
This electronic report was subjected to the same review
standard that applies to all U.S. Geological Survey
reports. Reviewers were asked to check the topological
consistency, tolerances, attribute frequencies and statistics,
projection, and geographic extent. The reviewers checked the
metadata and a_readme.1st files for completeness and accuracy.
Related_Spatial_and_Tabular_Data_Sets:
Data for wells and test holes completed in the Minnekahta
Limestone, Deadwood Formation, Minnelusa Formation, and the
Inyan Kara Group (mnktswpt, ddwdswpt, mnlsswpt, inkrswpt). As
well as digital coverage of the top of the Madison Limestone
(mdsnscon) and surficial geology in the Black Hills
Area(hydrogeo).

downloaded from the GWSI database in a delimited ASCII text

2.The ASCII file was then imported into Microsoft Excel so
that fields not present in the GWSI data base could be
added. Information such as elevations of geologic formation
tops, and hole depth were taken from well logs on-file at
the U.S. Geological Survey office in Rapid City, South
Dakota.

3.The Microsoft Excel file was then exported as a delimited
text file so that a point coverage could be created in
ARC/INFO.

4.The locations and attributes were verified.

AREA: Area of the point (assigned zero).

PERIMETER: Perimeter of the point (assigned zero).

MDSNSWPT#: An ARC/INFO generated internal feature identity
number.

MDSNSWPT-ID: User-assigned feature identity number.

SITEID, LOCAL, ALTITUDE, and OWNER, were retrieved from the
USGS Ground Water Site Inventory data base, all others were
created by staff of the BHHS. Note: values of 9999 indicate no
data.
------------------------------------------------------------------

SITEID: This is a unique number given to each well. SITEID is
a combination of the latitude and longitude of the well, plus
a sequence number for wells located at the same latitude and
longitude. (Note: The latitudes or longitudes originally
assigned to sites in GWSI occasionally are determined to be
incorrect. In these cases, the latitude or longitude is
corrected, but the station identification number generally
remains unchanged. Thus, the latitude or longitude for an
occasional site may not correspond exactly with the station
identification number).

LOCAL  This is a unique number based on the Federal
land-survey system for western South Dakota. LOCAL consists of
the township number followed by "N" or "S" (north or south of
the Black Hills Baseline), the range number followed by "E" or
"W" (east or west of the Black Hills Meridian), and the
section number, followed by a maximum of four uppercase
letters that indicate, respectively, the 160-, 40-, 10-, and
2.5-acre tract in which the site is located. These letters are
assigned in a counterclockwise direction beginning with the
letter "A" for the northeast quarter. A serial number
following the last letter is used to distinguish between wells
located in the same 2.5-acre tract.

ALTITUDE: This is the elevation of the well head above mean
sea level, NGVD29.

DEPTHMDSN: The depth to the top of the Madison Limestone below
land surface.

ALTMDSN: The elevation of the top of the Madison Limestone
above mean sea level, NGVD29.

CHECK: A single character denoting if the well had been site
visited or not. A "U" denotes unchecked and a "C" denotes
field checked.

MDSN: Value from ALTMDSN rounded to nearest integer value.
