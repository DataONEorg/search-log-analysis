 <abstract><para>We monitored densities of moltin harlequin ducks and broods in oil spill area of western Prince William Sound (WPWS) and in the non-oiled eastern area (EPWS) during July and August 1993. The shoreline density indices of molting harlequin ducks in in WPWS was consistently lower than those in EPWS. These data indicate that the densities of molting harlequin ducks were greater in the unoiled portions of PWS, suggesting differential use because of oil effects or regional ecological differences. Differences in survey timing and coverage among years contributed an unknown margin of error in comparisons across years and regions. The lack of pre-spill baseline population data and habitat differences between WPWS and EPWS preclude distinguishing oil spill effects from other ecological or demographic variation.</para>

<para>We conducted shoreline surveys to determine location and distribution of harlequin ducks within coastal habitats. Surveys were conducted by 2-3 observers aboard a skiff (2-7 m in length) at a distance of 5-50 m from shore, around islands, exposed rocks, and into embayments, lagoons and stream deltas. We used low speeds (0-10 km/hr) when searching for harlequin ducks in shoals and emergent rocky habitat. Higher speeds (up to 30 km/hr) were used when searching nearshore, deep water habitat not generally used by molting harlequin ducks. We avoided surveying when weather and seas limited visibility. When harlequin ducks were encountered the engine was turned off and skiff was allowed to drift quietly toward the flock.</para>
<para>Harlequin ducks were counted and classified to sex when possible using 10x binoculars. Harlequin ducks exhibit sexual dimorphism, including in body size. Adult females are approximately 85% the size of adult males by weight (bellrose, 1980, Crowley and Patten, 1996). Molting males appear larger and darker than females. Males appear predominately black or dark brown, adult males have white wing markings, subadult males have mottled bellies. Females are lighter brown, have less distinct face patches, no white wing marking, and have mottled, cream-colored bellies. The dark colored heads and distinctive face patch of males were the most reliable indicators in separating molting males from females.</para>
<para>Surveys in EPWS and WPWS were conducted simultaneously, although WPWS surveys required more time to complete because of greater distances covered, and generally poorer weather conditions. We derived a shoreline density index (SDI = number of ducks per km of shoreline surveyed) of harlequins for comparison of study areas and years.</para>
<para>Selection of survey areas was prioritized first on covering areas surveyed in previous years (particularly where harlequins were observed), then on additional coverage where harlequins might be present (i.e. shallow sloping beachers rather than steep bluffs and cliffs). No effort was made to randomize coverage, but rather to maximize coverage and harlequins counted.</para>
<para>We recorded habitat types used by molting harlequin ducks. Areas surveyed and sites occupied by harlequin ducks in WPWS were identified by a system of numbered beach segments used by clean-up crews. This segment system provided a history of initial oiling conitions and clean-up activities within habitats used by harlequin ducks. Because mussel beds retained more oil relative to the surrounding environment through 1993, and mussels are a localized food source important to harlequins the proximity of molting flocks to mussel beds was recorded. Distances of molting harlequins to mussel beds were classified as within or not within easy swimming distnace of flightless ducks.</para>

<para>We recorded broods of harlequins encountered during boat surveys. Ducklings were classified by plumage characteristics into one of seven age class: IA-III to preclude misidentification with molting females. The following criteria for identification of broods were compiled from previous years observations of broods particularly from EPWS where broods were compiled from previous years observations of broods, particularly from EPWS where broods were more commonly observed from hatchling to near-fledging age classes.</para>
<para>Harlequin ducklings observed in July and early August were distinguishable from females by smaller size, presence of down, and broody behavior. As ducklings approached adult size (class III), they became more difficult to differentiate from adult females. Upon scrutiny with 10x binoculars, remnant down on head or back was sometimes apparent on ducklings. Ducklings also had darker faces and bills than females. The large face patch on ducklings was graying instead of white, and body plumage appeared slightly lighter than that of females. Ducklings had rounded, vascularized wing-tips compared to molting adults, which has pointed wing tips when primary feathers were molted or not fully grown. For adult-sized ducklings, approaching slowly by boat helped distinguish broods from mixed flocks of molters. When less than 30 m from suspected broods and using 10x binoculars, behavioral observations helped distinguish class IIc and III ducklings from females. Molting or flight-capable adults swam rapidly or few away, while ducklings followed the female, responded to her calls, and were unable to escape by rapid swimming. We believe that these criteria were fairly reliable through class II ducklings. However, small flocks of molting females were sometimes indistinguishable from class III broods. When in doubt, we classified these groups as molting females rather than as broods.</para>
<para>Brood surveys were best conducted during the last week of July and first 2 weeks of August, after hatching was essentially complete and before fledging began because fledged ducklings were nearly impossible to distinguish from females. SDIs of broods (number of broods/100 km) were compared between study areas and survey years.</para>
