overall system dynamics has lagged far behind our extension of
knowledge of aboveground processes. In consideration of the great
importance of belowground dynamics, precision studies of root
production and turnover in relation to the microenvironmental
regulatory complex are needed. The Virginia Coast Reserve LTER site
provides an opportunity to approach eseresearch goals in the
context of a nutrient poor, physically dynamic landscape. A broad
spatial and temporal perspective is required in this system as the
landscape is shifting and changingin time and space. There is a
need to understand the links between belowground processes and the
exceptionally dynamic microenvironment of the barrier islands.</para><para>The overall objective of this study is to quantify root
production and turnover along a topographic gradient on Hog Island
and relate these processes to the microenvironmental complex as
precisely as possible. The specific objective of the 1989 field
work was to conduct a pilot study to determine the distribution of
root mass (with particular interest in large roots) by soil depth
along already established transects on Hog Island. These transects
extend along topographic gradients in accreting and eroding areas
of the island. Pit excavations were used. The results provided an
initial picture of root distribution patterns and will provide a
framework for planning process related studies in subsequent field
seasons.</para><para>METHODS</para><para>The study made use of the system of transects established on Hog
Island. Sample stations were located along transect 2 on the
northern, accreting end of the island. The communities on the
northern end of the island grade inland from open beach to
Ammophila breviligulata dominance to dense Spartina patens to
Myrica cerifera thickets. Five stations were positioned along the
transect to span the gradation in elevation and to represent major
community types. From east to west, the communities sampled were an
Ammophila dominated dune, a Spartina patens interdunal marsh, a
Myrica thicket, an interior Spartina patens marsh, and an older
Myrica stand.</para><para>Ten sample points per station were randomly located within a 100
m 2 area. At each point, a 0.25 m 2 pit was excavated in 10 cm
depth intervals to 40 cm during the summer of 1989. The marsh sites
were excavated to 20 cm because of high water. The roots were
separated from the soil by washing and seiving, categorized by
major diameter classes, dried at 70 C and weighed. The roots are
currently being analyzed colorimetrically for total N and P on a
Scientific Instruments Autoanalyzer.</para><para>Variation in root mass by depth, size class, topographic
position, and community type will be statistically evaluated by
ANOVA and appropriate a posterori tests. The analysis has not yet
been completed.</para><para>RESULTS</para><para>In this study, the Spartina communities experienced periodic
flooding and the root zone was commonly saturated. The Myrica
stands and the Ammophila community occupied higher micro
topographic positions and were generally found on sandier soils.
Presumably the older communities are located toward the island
interior. On the sites excavated to 40 cm, most root biomass was in
the top 20 cm of soil (Table 1). Distribution of root mass among
size classes varied among sites. The mass of large roots was
greater than fine roots in the top 20 cm on the shrub sites and
dune, but the opposite was observed on the Spartina sites. On the
Spartina sites, most of the biomass was in the &lt; 2 mm size
class. The 2 - 5 mm size class dominated the dune site, and the
&gt; 5 mm size class dominated the Myrica sites. Young (pers.
comm.) has suggested that nodulation in Myrica is more abundant
toward the ocean and near the surface on larger roots. Our study
indicated that the large surficial roots are prominant in the
Myrica communities. Fine root biomass (&lt; 2 mm diameter) in the
top 10 cm of soil was greater on the Spartina sites than the Myrica
sites, but there was very little difference among sites at the
lower depths (Table 1). The fine root biomass in the top 10 cm
increased toward the island interior among the grass sites and
among the shrub sites. The same pattern held for larger roots among
the shrub sites. Several clear and interesting patterns in biomass
were apparent; variation in process rates should also be
expected.</para><para>The N and P analyses and statistical analysis of the data should
be complete by summer 1990. The results of this initial study will
provide a framework for guiding process related studies we hope to
initiate in 1990.</para></section></description></methodStep></methods><project scope="document"><title>Belowground biomass allocation along a topographic and successional continuum on Hog Island.</title><personnel scope="document"><individualName><givenName>Frank</givenName><surName>Day</surName></individualName><address scope="document"><deliveryPoint>Old Dominion University, Department of Biological Sciences</deliveryPoint><city>Norfolk</city><administrativeArea>VA</administrativeArea><postalCode>23529-0266</postalCode></address><phone phonetype="voice">(757) 683-4198</phone><phone phonetype="facsimile">(757) 683-5283</phone><electronicMailAddress>fday@odu.edu</electronicMailAddress><role>originator</role></personnel><abstract><section><para>Understanding belowground processes and how they link with
