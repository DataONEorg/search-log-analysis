This part of DS 781 presents the seafloor-character map Offshore of Pacifica, California. The raster data file is included in "SFC_OffshorePacifica.zip," which is accessible from http://pubs.usgs.gov/ds/781/OffshorePacifica/data_catalog_OffshorePacifica.html.

This raster-format seafloor-character map shows four substrate classes of Offshore of Pacifica, California. The substrate classes mapped in this area have been further divided into the following California Marine Life Protection Act depth zones and slope classes: Depth Zone 2 (intertidal to 30 m), Depth Zone 3 (30 to 100 m), and Slope Class 1 (0 degrees - 5 degrees). Depth Zone 1 (intertidal), Depth Zones 4-5 (greater than 100 m), and Slopes Classes 2-4 (greater than 5 degrees) are not present in the region covered by this block. The map is created using a supervised classification method described by Cochrane (2008), available at http://doc.nprb.org/web/research/research%20pubs/615_habitat_mapping_workshop/Individual%20Chapters%20High-Res/Ch13%20Cochrane.pdf.

The seafloor-character map was produced using video-supervised maximum likelihood classification of the bathymetry and intensity of return from sonar systems. The classification was supervised using signatures defined by hand-drawn polygons located through sediment samples and video-observation ground truthing applying methodology described in Cochrane (2008), available at http://doc.nprb.org/web/research/research%20pubs/615_habitat_mapping_workshop/Individual%20Chapters%20High-Res/Ch13%20Cochrane.pdf. The two variants used in this classification were backscatter intensity and derivative rugosity. Rugosity measures terrain ruggedness as the variation in three-dimensional orientation of grid cells within a neighborhood. Vector analysis is used to calculate the dispersion of vectors normal (orthogonal) to grid cells within the specified neighborhood. This method effectively captures variability in slope and aspect into a single measure. Ruggedness values in the output raster map can range from 0 (no terrain variation) to 1 (complete terrain variation). The calculation was performed using the Terrain Ruggedness (VRM) tool (for details, see Sappington and others, 2007).
Classes I, II and III values were delineated using multivariate analysis. Class IV (mobile sedimentary features) values were determined on the basis of visual characteristics using both bathymetry and backscatter (slight depression in the seafloor, very high backscatter return). The resulting map (gridded at 2 m) was cleaned by hand to remove data-collection artifacts (for example trackline nadir). Editing was performed in Photoshop, with which individual pixels were selected and values adjusted to remove noise.  Selection occurred without antialiasing, and the resulting grid was identical but for the edited pixels. The four seafloor classes were then colored to indicate which of the five California MLPA  depth zones they are located in: Depth Zone 2 (intertidal to 30 m), Depth Zone 3 (30 to 100 m), Depth Zone 4 (100 to 200 m), or Depth Zone 5 (greater than 200 m).  These were further subdivided into one of the following slope classes: Slope Class 1 (0 degrees - 5 degrees), Slope Class 2 (5 degrees - 30 degrees), Slope Class 3 (30 degrees - 60 degrees), or Slope Class 4 (60 degrees - 90 degrees). Depth Zone 1 (intertidal), Depth Zone 4-5 (greater than 100 m), and Slopes Classes 2-4 (greater than 5 degrees) are not present in the region covered by this block.
