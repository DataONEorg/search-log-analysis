      <abstract>In cooperation with the Ohio Department of Transportation and the U.S. Department of Transportation, Federal Highway Administration, 
the USGS developed a database of geomorphic data for a sampling of unregulated natural alluvial streams in Ohio.  The vector point shapefile that these 
metadata describe is based on this geomorphic database and consists of 50 points and associated attributes.  The database was developed as part of
a study to develop methods to estimate bankfull characteristics of Ohio streams and to relate geomorphic characteristics of Ohio streams to peak 
streamflows of selected recurrence intervals.   The results of the study are presented in a report by Sherwood and Huitger (2005).

The database developed for this study consists of geomorphic, basin, and flood-frequency characteristics for 50 study sites in Ohio, of which 40 sites are 
near streamflow-gaging stations.  Field surveys were done at each site to collect the geomorphic data.  Bankfull indicators were identified and evaluated, 
cross-section and longitudinal profiles were surveyed, and bed- and bank-material were sampled.  Field data were analyzed to determine various geomorphic 
characteristics such as bankfull width, bankfull mean depth, bankfull cross-sectional area, bankfull discharge, streambed slope, and bed- and bank-material 
particle-size distribution.  

The various geomorphic characteristics were analyzed by means of a combination of graphical and statistical techniques. These techniques resulted in a set 
of regional curves, simple-regression (drainage-area only) equations, and multiple-regression equations to estimate bankfull width, bankfull mean depth, bankfull 
cross-sectional area, and bankfull discharge.  Explanatory variables included drainage area, main-channel slope, main-channel elevation index, median 
bed-material particle size, bankfull cross-sectional area, and local-channel slope.  Average standard errors of prediction for bankfull width equations 
ranged from 20.6 to 24.8 percent; for bankfull mean depth, 18.8 to 20.6 percent; for bankfull cross-sectional area, 25.4 to 30.6 percent; and for bankfull 
discharge, 27.0 to 78.7 percent.  The simple-regression (drainage-area only) equations have the highest average standard errors of prediction.  The 
multiple-regression equations-in which the explanatory variables included drainage area, main-channel slope, main-channel elevation index, median 
bed-material particle size, bankfull cross-sectional area, and local-channel slope-have the lowest average standard errors of prediction.

Statistical and graphical analyses were done to investigate development of methods to estimate flood-peak discharges from geomorphic characteristics 
based on the 40 study sites at streamflow-gaging stations.   The logarithms of the annual peak discharges for each site were fit by a Pearson Type III 
frequency distribution to develop a flood-peak-frequency relation for each site.  The peak-frequency data were related to geomorphic, basin, and climatic 
variables of the 40 study sites by multiple-regression analysis.  The analyses resulted in a set of multiple-regression equations to estimate flood-peak 
discharge having recurrence intervals of 2, 5, 10, 25, 50, and 100 years from bankfull cross-sectional area, in which the average standard errors of 
prediction are 31.6, 32.6, 35.9, 41.5, 46.2, and 51.2 percent, respectively.

      <purpose>The data set was used to develop methods to estimate bankfull characteristics of Ohio streams and to relate geomorphic characteristics
of Ohio streams to peak streamflows of selected recurrence intervals.   The database and methods developed also are intended to improve the 
understanding of the relations between geomorphic, basin, and flood characteristics of streams in Ohio and to aid in the design of hydraulic structures, 
such as culverts and bridges, where stability of the stream and structure is an important element of the design criteria.

    <overview>
      <eaover>The database consists of geomorphic, basin, and flood-frequency characteristics for 50 study sites in Ohio, of which 40 sites are near 
streamflow-gaging stations.  Field surveys were done at each site to collect the geomorphic data.  Bankfull indicators were identified and evaluated, cross-section 
and longitudinal profiles were surveyed, and bed- and bank-material were sampled.  Field data were analyzed to determine various geomorphic characteristics 
such as bankfull width, bankfull mean depth, bankfull cross-sectional area, bankfull discharge, streambed slope, and bed- and bank-material particle-size distribution.  
The logarithms of the annual peak discharges for each site were fit by a Pearson Type III frequency distribution to develop the peak-streamflow data for the 40 sites 
near streamflow-gaging stations.American Society of Testing Materials, 1998, Standard Methods for Particle-Size Analysis of Soils, in 1998 Annual Book of
