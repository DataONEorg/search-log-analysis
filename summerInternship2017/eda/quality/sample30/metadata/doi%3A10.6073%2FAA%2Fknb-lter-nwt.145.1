Dowels consisted  of untreated Gonystylus bancanus wood. Dowels were 12 cm in  length and inserted 10 cm into the ground, so that  approximately 2 cm of the length remained aboveground.</para></abstract><keywordSet><keyword>NWT</keyword><keyword>Niwot Ridge LTER Site</keyword><keyword>LTER</keyword><keyword>Colorado</keyword><keyword>alpine</keyword><keyword>decomposition</keyword><keyword>wood</keyword></keywordSet><distribution scope="document"><online><url function="download">http://culter.colorado.edu/exec/.extracttoolA?woodecom.ts</url></online></distribution><coverage scope="document"><temporalCoverage scope="document"><rangeOfDates><beginDate><calendarDate>1992-09-12</calendarDate></beginDate><endDate><calendarDate>2003-09-09</calendarDate></endDate></rangeOfDates></temporalCoverage><geographicCoverage scope="document"><geographicDescription></geographicDescription><boundingCoordinates><westBoundingCoordinate>-105.643</westBoundingCoordinate><eastBoundingCoordinate>-105.3753</eastBoundingCoordinate><northBoundingCoordinate>40.0615</northBoundingCoordinate><southBoundingCoordinate>39.9932</southBoundingCoordinate></boundingCoordinates></geographicCoverage></coverage><maintenance><description><para>The initial iteration of this file was generated by Heather O&apos;Lear in early January 1994. Minor editorial revisions were made to the documentation and header sections of the file by RCI on 10 January 1994 and the file was put under sccs  control on that date as well.[RCI 10 January 1994] After  conversation with HO&apos;L and TS on 11 January 1994, it was decided that the initial columns were unnecessary, since they contained descriptive information that would only be of use if the data were merged with other data sets. Thus, these  columns (and the associated header information) were deleted from the file. Additional comments regarding initial weight calculations and related issues were added at this time as well.[RCI 11 January 1994] Additional detail regarding  specific site locations was provided by TS and incorporated into the documentation and data sections on 11 January 1994.
