Temperature and snow density were measured at various depths throughout the snow cover profiles in order to characterize the temperature and snow water equivalent (SWE) of the snowpack throughout the year. Snow density was measured at 10-cm  intervals using a 1000-ml cutter. Data on snow grain qualities were collected beginning in the 1994-95 snow season.</para></abstract><keywordSet><keyword>NWT</keyword><keyword>Niwot Ridge LTER Site</keyword><keyword>LTER</keyword><keyword>Colorado</keyword><keyword>temperature</keyword><keyword>Saddle grid</keyword><keyword>snow</keyword><keyword>snow depth</keyword><keyword>snow mass</keyword><keyword>snow pit</keyword><keyword>snow profile</keyword><keyword>snow temperature</keyword><keyword>snow water equivalen</keyword></keywordSet><distribution scope="document"><online><url function="download">http://culter.colorado.edu/exec/.extracttoolA?snowateq.mw</url></online></distribution><coverage scope="document"><temporalCoverage scope="document"><rangeOfDates><beginDate><calendarDate>1993-02-26</calendarDate></beginDate><endDate><calendarDate>2006-06-06</calendarDate></endDate></rangeOfDates></temporalCoverage><geographicCoverage scope="document"><geographicDescription></geographicDescription><boundingCoordinates><westBoundingCoordinate>-105.643</westBoundingCoordinate><eastBoundingCoordinate>-105.3753</eastBoundingCoordinate><northBoundingCoordinate>40.0615</northBoundingCoordinate><southBoundingCoordinate>39.9932</southBoundingCoordinate></boundingCoordinates></geographicCoverage></coverage><maintenance><description><para>The documentation section of this file was constructed by Susan Kindig, Rick Ingersoll, and Mark Williams during late May of 1993.
