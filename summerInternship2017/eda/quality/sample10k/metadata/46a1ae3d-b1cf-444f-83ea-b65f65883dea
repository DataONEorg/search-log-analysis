    <descript>
      <abstract>Topographic survey data were collected along planned lines from the river water surface to the top of the bank in the study area. Topographic survey data collection began on May 22 and concluded on June 10, 2014. A real-time kinematic (RTK) GNSS network provided real-time survey grade horizontal and vertical positioning.</abstract>
      <purpose>Topographic data were collected to extend the land-surface elevation from the intersection with the existing water surface to high-elevation areas that are not inundated during bankfull conditions.</purpose>

    <attracc>
      <attraccr>Topographic data represents actual points recorded on the ground. All attributes were generated within Tribmle Survey Controller software. Accuracy of the coordinates was largely reliant on the quality of the geoid model (MAPGEOID2010) and the . To test the quality of the geoid model, an additional static survey was completed at RN972G near the Catedral de Sao Francisco das Chagas, matriz de Barra. The published elevation for RN972G is 406.662m. The result of the static survey was 406.26m, a difference of about 0.4m. It it important to note that the two elevations were calculated using different methods, and the referenced time frames (epoch) and coordinate systems may not align. Additionally, the referenced geoid model is course and may contain additional uncertainties that cannot be quantified. Accuracy cannot be qualified due to the lack of high quality bench marks to check against in the study area; the GNSS survey data is presented in terms of precision.</attraccr>
    </attracc>
    <logic>Recording a check shot on the reference bench mark at the beginning and end of each day was a useful quality assurance method to determine if any errors had been introduced into the survey. The check shot was reviewed in the field to determine if any significant horizontal or vertical coordinate shifts occurred.</logic>
    <complete>Topography was collected along major breaks in the terrain from the river water surface to a point extending about 10 m beyond the top of bank. Topography was collected as a series of points along most of the planned lines; however, some areas were not accessible due to ground vegetation and overhead canopy cover.</complete>

      <procstep>
        <procdesc>Prior to the start of the topographic survey, two static survey files were collected and post-processed on May 21 using IBGE precise point positioning (PPP) to establish &#8220;ultra-rapid&#8221; (Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics, 2008) solutions for each of the two primary bench marks. The ultra-rapid static solution was used for the duration of the survey and provided reasonably accurate (±15 cm) coordinates for each bench mark (Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics, 2013). Final coordinates were not required during the field survey, but reasonable accuracy was necessary to navigate the planned survey lines. Static GNSS data were collected daily at the base station (primary bench mark) and post-processed using the IBGE PPP and the baseline processing and network adjustment software. In July 2014, all static survey files collected at the base station receiver were processed using the IBGE-PPP (Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics, 2013). Selected static files associated with the most precise IBGE-PPP results were post-processed using baseline processing and network-adjustment procedures (Trimble Navigation Limited, 2014). Final primary bench mark horizontal and vertical coordinates were established from the fully constrained network adjustment (Rydlund and Densmore, 2012). Fully constrained network adjusted solutions for each of the primary bench marks, RSF1 and RSF2, were directly tied into Brazilian Network for Continuous Monitoring of GNSS Systems (RBMC) using six sites surrounding the study area (Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics, 2008, 2013). Fully constrained, network-adjusted final primary bench mark coordinates typically provide the least amount of uncertainty (opposed to the IBGE-PPP results) (Rydlund and Densmore, 2012). Static GNSS data were not collected at the reference bench marks; therefore, network adjusted solution could not be calculated.Topography data were exported into Trimble® Business Center and survey locations, antenna heights, and data quality were reviewed for errors. After the final bench mark coordinates were established, all topographic survey data previously imported were shifted from ultra-rapid to final primary bench mark coordinates. Data were shifted based on the local geographic coordinate reference system (latitude, longitude, and ellipsoid height) using Trimble® Business Center (Trimble Navigation Limited, 2014). Final output included both geographic coordinates (latitude, longitude, ellipsoid height) and projected coordinates (northing, easting, elevation).</procdesc>
