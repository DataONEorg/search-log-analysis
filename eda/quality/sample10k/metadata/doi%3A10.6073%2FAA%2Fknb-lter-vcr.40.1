pugnax</emphasis>) burrows on soil nutrients and the marsh grass<emphasis>Spartina alterniflora</emphasis>.</para><para>Tall-form<emphasis>Spartina alterniflora</emphasis>(1-2m tall) typically
dominates the marsh area that is flooded daily by tides. The
short-form<emphasis>S. alterniflora</emphasis>(&amp;lt;0.5m tall) generally occupies
the higher tidal heights (Bertness 1985). These short-form<emphasis>S.
alterniflora</emphasis>are charterized by reduced soil drainage
(Mendelssohn and Senecs 1980; Howes et al. 1981; Mendelssohn et al.
1981) and increased soil sulfide levels (King et al. 1982).</para><para>From comparing control areas devoid of burrrows to those with
burrows added, an increase in above-ground<emphasis>Spartina
alterniflora</emphasis>production has been observed along with an
increase of soil drainage rates and redox potential levels
(Bertness 1985). Others have looked at how nutrient availability
(Mendelssohn 1979) and sulfide accumulation (King et al. 1982;
Howarth and Giblin 1983) may be the primary limiting factors
controlling the production</para><para>and success of<emphasis>S. alterniflora</emphasis>. While soil water movement
has been shown to influence the soil parameters, (i.e., sulfide
concentration and redox potential) that directly affect cordgrass
production (King et al. 1982; Koch et al. 1990), little has been
studied on how biotic modifications, such as crab burrows, mediate
these physical factors.</para><para>The<emphasis>Uca pugnax</emphasis>, are burrowing deposit-feeders that
excavate and maintain semi-permanent burrows in the marsh surface.
They have been found to not only oxygenate marsh soils (Howes et al
1981) and modify sediment meiofaunal abundance, they could also
provide a suitable environment for continued burrowing and, as a
byproduct, increase the marsh grass production and maintain the
tall-form<emphasis>S. alterniflora</emphasis>.<emphasis>Uca pugnax</emphasis>, the</para><para>mud fiddler crab, is the dominant form of crab seen in
Brownsville, VA. Their burrows are primarily restricted to areas of
tall-form<emphasis>S. alterniflora</emphasis>, due to the intermediate substrate
hardness and root mat density (Bertness and Miller 1985).
Therefore, the effects of burrows will be more evident when studied
in areas of shorter<emphasis>S. alterniflora</emphasis>with minimal burrow
density.</para><para>The objective of this study was to compare areas of minimal
burrow density to those with burrows added, in shorter<emphasis>S.
alterniflora</emphasis>on a mainland marsh. I hypothesized that the areas
with added burrows would show: (1) a decrease in soil sulfide
concentration, (2) changes in other nutrient concentrations and (3)
an increase in above- and below-ground growth of<emphasis>Spartina
alterniflora</emphasis>.</para><para>The marsh studied was in Brownsville, VA. The site was located
near the bank of No Name Creek. The focus of the experiment is on
the effect of crab burrows because there were some Sesarma
reticulatum burrows found. But more than 90% were created by<emphasis>Uca
pugnax</emphasis>.</para><para>In the first week of June 1992, 10 split-blocks were put in.
Each block contained 2 subplots, one control, the other the
treatment. The position of the subplots were randomly chosen. Each
0.5m x 0.5m subplot was marked off with PVC pipes at the corners.
The subplots all contained 2 sippers, one to 10cm depth, the other
to 20cm depth. They also all contained 3 litter bags, each one
measuring the below-ground root ingrowth at 10cm and 20cm. The 10
split-blocks were in a consecutive line, separated from each other
by 1m. They were situated to be parrallel to the creek bank, in the
intertidal zone.</para><para>To examine experimentally the influence of crab burrows, the
subplots designated as the controls were each counted for burrows
present and the diameter of each measured. The average diameter of
the burrows was found to be 1.5cm. For each controls&apos; respective
treeatment subplot, the number of burrows found in that control was
doubled for its treatment plot. These burrows were added
artifically by driving a 2 ft. long 1.5cm diameter PVC pipe into
the substrate. A week was allotted to allow the sippers and burrows
to equilibrate and the artifical burrows to be occupied. Bertness
and Miller (1984) had found that greater than 75% of their
artifical burrows were occupied after a week.</para><para>To asses the effects of crab burrows on sulphide, ammonia,
phosphate and salinity, the sippers were sampled weekly, at rising
high tide. At the end of the 9 weeks, all the<emphasis>Spartina
alterniflora</emphasis>in all the subplots was cut, dried and weighed.
The litter bags were removed, picked for roots, which were dried,
weighed and ash dried, to find the amount of organic carbon
present.</para><para>There was found to be a significant difference between the
controls and treatments in sulphide concentrations (p &amp;lt; 0.05)
and in phosphate concentrations (p &amp;lt; 0.25). There was a
significant difference between the two different sipper depths in
sulphide concentrations (p &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 0.01) and in phosphate
concentrations (p &amp;lt; 0.25). In all soil nutrients measured, a
significant difference in concentrations, over the 9 week period,
was found (p &amp;lt; 0.01). The results can be found in Table 1.</para><para>The above ground standing stock biomass was not statistically
significant between the controls and treatments. However, the
treatments were found to be 4% heavier than the controls. Thus,
there is a trend towards an increase in biomass due to the
treatment. The below-ground root ingrowth was not statistically
significant between the controls and treatments, but the treatments
were found to be 8.6% heavier than the controls. This may be an
indication of an increase in growth due to the added burrows,</para><para>From these results, there is evidence that crab burrows do
affect the sediment chemistry and plants present. The burrows do
seem to enhance the production of<emphasis>Spartina alterniflora</emphasis>and
to create a more favorable environment for continued burrowing and
for maintaining taller-form<emphasis>S. alterniflora</emphasis>. The addition of
burrows, resulting in the decrease of sulphide concentration in
situ and the altering of other soil chemistry, facilitated the
aeration of the soil and increased the potential production of<emphasis>S. alterniflora</emphasis>.</para><para>In all, the crabs present in the salt marsh appear to play an
important role in enhancing the productivity and structure of the
marshes.</para></abstract><keywordSet><keyword keywordType="theme">Nutrient Movements</keyword></keywordSet><intellectualRights><section><title>Data License</title><para>Data and documentation is copyrighted by The Virginia Coast Reserve LTER
