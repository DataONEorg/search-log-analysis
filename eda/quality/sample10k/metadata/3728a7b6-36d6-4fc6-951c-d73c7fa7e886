      <abstract>A RESON SeaBat™ 7125 multibeam echosounder in conjunction with an Applanix Position Orientation Solution for Marine Vessels (POS MV™) WaveMaster system motion sensor, HYPACK®/HYSWEEP® navigation software, and Ashtech Z-Xtreme GPS receivers or Trimble R8 receivers was used to survey the Missouri River bed at 15 pipeline crossings at four different locations, at three power plant locations, and at one transmission tower during the 2011 flood event.  The format of this data is a grid with each cell covering 0.5 meter by 0.5 meter.  The elevation value (North American Vertical Datum, NAVD88) represented by each cell is the most probable elevation for that cell based on calculated Total Propagated Uncertainty (TPU) as calculated in Caris HIPS and SIPS software.  Calculated TPS values are then used by Caris to create a Combined Uncertainty and Bathymetric Estimator (CUBE) surface.  The surface grid was used to export the cell centroid position (Northing, Easting in UTM zone 14 North, in meters) along with the cell elevation (referenced to NAVD88, in meters) to create the text file.  The data were collected by the U.S. Geological Survey in cooperation with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Omaha Public Power District (OPPD).</abstract>
      <purpose>The data collection effort was conducted in order to provide detailed hydrographic data for EPA and OPPD to use in evaluation of the effects of the 2011 Missouri River flood on the safety of pipelines, power plant operations, and a transmission tower.  </purpose>

      <horizpa>
        <horizpar>Horizontal accuracy is dependent on the accuracy of the GPS surveyed position, the accuracy of the sonar angle measurement, the accuracy of the boat motion data, and the accuracy of the sonar distance measurement.  The GPS survey is based off USGS established benchmarks utilizing the NGS Online Positioning Users Service.  The benchmarks processed through OPUS with peak to peak error estimates in latitude ranging from 0.004 to 0.036 m and ranging in longitude from 0.003 to 0.073 m.  GPS accuracy is not only determined by the base station accuracy, but also by the accuracy of the rover unit.  The rover unit used during multibeam surveying is an Applanix POS MV™ WaveMaster which utilized the base station correction information along with data from two GPS antennas mounted on the survey boat and an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU).  The positional accuracy of the rover unit can range from 0.02-0.10 m, depending on the quality of the differential corrections, based on specifications given for the POS MV™ Wavemaster.  The accuracy of the data included in this release should be at the lower end of this range since only fixed positions are used.  In addition, the specifications for the POS MV™ WaveMaster show that the unit can estimate roll and pitch of the boat with an accuracy of 0.02 degrees utilizing real-time kinematic corrections for position.  Resolution of depth estimation (or sonar travel distance) as described by Reson for the SeaBat™ 7125 multibeam echosounder is 0.005 m.</horizpar>

        <vertaccr>Vertical accuracy is dependent on the accuracy of the GPS surveyed elevation, the accuracy of the boat motion, and the accuracy of the depth estimation.  The GPS survey is based off USGS established benchmarks utilizing the NGS Online Positioning Users Service.  The benchmarks processed through OPUS with peak to peak error estimates in the ellipsoid ranging from 0.013 to 0.056 m and in the orthometric ranging from 0.020 to 0.095 m.  GPS elevation accuracy is not only determined by the base station accuracy, but also by the accuracy of the rover unit.  The rover unit used during multibeam surveying is an Applanix POS MV™ WaveMaster which utilized the base station correction information along with data from two GPS antennas mounted on the survey boat and an inertial measurement unit (IMU).  Only data coded as a "fixed" position by the POS-MV is used to determine water surface elevations.  The position accuracy of the rover unit can range from 0.02-0.10 m, depending on the quality of the differential corrections, based on specifications given for the POS MV™ Wavemaster. The accuracy of the data included in this release should be at the lower end of this range since only fixed positions were used.  In addition, the specifications for the POS MV™ WaveMaster show that the unit can estimate roll and pitch of the boat with an accuracy of 0.02 degrees utilizing RTK.  Resolution of depth estimation as described by Reson for the SeaBat™ 7125 multibeam echosounder is 0.005 m.</vertaccr>
