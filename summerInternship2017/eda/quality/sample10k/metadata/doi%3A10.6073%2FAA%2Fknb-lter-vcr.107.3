center stakes. In the absence of a located center stake (such as
when redox reactions in the marsh soil and saline tidal flooding
corroded and toppled the rebar stake), the center was relocated by
triangulating from tagged trees and shrubs (if present) or from
locator landmarks coupled with the original plot maps (location
relative to canopy gaps or vegetation zonation patterns). A new
center stake was installed or at least marked with flagging if the
old stake was not found. The location of new plots was described as
before. New low and upper salt marsh plots were not located
entirely randomly as were previous upland and fresh and brackish
marsh plots; they were chosen in a stratified-random pattern of
paired creek-side and marsh-interior plots along tidal creeks that
allowed boat access. The marsh-interior plots were located 50-100m
distant at random azimuth (but on same side of access creek) from
the creek-side plots.</para><para>GPS coordinates were recorded to the nearest 1/100th of a minute
accuracy when there was sufficient signal strength (but this data
should be supplanted by the 2002 Post-fire GPS coordinate data
where available).</para><para>All plots are 1/12th ha radial plots with a radius of 16.3 m.
For the full plot, all tree stems and shrub clumps &gt;2.5cm DBH
were mapped, tagged, and measured for DBH and height. Each plot
contains 3-6 (usually 5) subplots for sampling the herbaceous
ground cover and LAI. Each subplot was randomly located except that
an effort was made so that all the subplots were not clustered in
the same quarter or half of any plot.</para><para>Anytime that species-id codes were used to identify the
vegetation being measured, these IDs match those from the
VCR-LTER&apos;s list of SPECID codes (based on the first letter of Genus
and next two consonants then first letter of species and next two
consonants). If something was only IDed to genus, then XXX was
filled in for the last three letters of the species code (ex.
SMLXXX for Smilax spp.). For some mixes of species a common-form
name was used, such as &quot;grass&quot; for any mix of unidentified
combination of upland grass species, &quot;herb&quot; for unknown herbaceous
species, or &quot;salthay&quot; for a mix in various proportions of Spartina
patens and Distichilis spicata.</para><para><emphasis>* SESSION DATA</emphasis></para><para>Session data lists just the weather conditions during collection
(esp. of the ceptometer readings), the names of the surveyors and
data recorders, the date, and whether it was the first time the
plot was visited this year (once for most plots) or if this was a
revisit for cross-site calibration of within-growing-season
temporal trends in standing biomass and leaf area index (LAI).</para><para><emphasis>* TREE DATA</emphasis></para><para>All woody species with typical &quot;tree&quot; growth form of a single
upright vertical stem (excluding Myrica cerifera, Baccharis
halmifolia, and Iva frutescens which have a typical clumped forked
twisted-and-bent bushy &quot;shrub&quot; growth form) that measured at least
2.5 cm at DBH (diameter at breast height, 1.37 m) were mapped and
measured. Each tree stem was permanently tagged with a numbered
aluminum tag nailed into the trunk near the base. In the case of
trees that forked below DBH, each fork was measured and recorded as
a separate tree (to reflect the corresponding canopy
characteristics), although it was noted which collection of tagged
stems constituted a single &quot;real&quot; tree. Heavily leaning trees were
noted as leaning but still measured at the point where they reached
a height of 1.37m (DBH) above the base of the trunk, regardless of
the length of the bole needed to reach this height. Leaning or
horizontal trees with vertical limbs &gt;2.5cm DBH that separated
from the main bole below DBH level were treated as forked trees.
Azimuth from the plot center to each stem relative to true north
was recorded to the nearest full degree using compasses. Radial
distance from the plot center to each stem was recorded to the
nearest 0.5m using tape measures and/or Sonin electronic distance
measuring units (which were a definite improvement over the optical
rangefinders used in 1992-93).</para><para>For each previously tagged tree being resurveyed, azimuths and
distances were only corrected as needed. For previously untagged
trees that have subsequently reached 2.5cm DBH or greater, all
necessary measurements were made and the new stems tagged. New tags
were added to older trees whenever their previous tags had been
grown over or gnawed beyond readability.</para><para>The 1996 condition of each tree was noted using the following
codes:</para><para><orderedlist><listitem><para>1 = live (upright unforked) tree in apparently good/healthy
condition.</para></listitem><listitem><para>2 = live leaning and/or forked tree in apparently good/healthy
condition.</para></listitem><listitem><para>3 = live tree in poor condition (ex. mostly dead, with broken
or bent top, etc.).</para></listitem><listitem><para>4 = dead standing tree, still upright or leaning with much of
its crown intact.</para></listitem><listitem><para>5 = dead standing snag, bole only, still upright or leaning but
with a broken off top or otherwise missing its crown.</para></listitem><listitem><para>6 = dead fallen tree, fallen over from windthrow with a
partially uprooted root ball.</para></listitem><listitem><para>7 = dead fallen tree, fallen over due to a broken bole near the
base of the trunk.</para></listitem><listitem><para>8 = missing and presumably dead tree with no sign of the trunk
and/or tag.</para></listitem></orderedlist></para><para>(actual field codes were 1,2,0,3,6,4,5,7 resp. but were reordered
during data entry).  Only live trees (condition 1-3) were measured for DBH and
height. DBH was measured to the nearest 0.1 cm. Height was
estimated to the nearest 0.5 m., based on canopy height relative to
human surveyors, to neighboring trees, and to 1-3 (or more) trees
per plot whose heights were measured with clinometers. This differs
from the 1992-93 estimations that did not use clinometers. For the
1-3 trees with measured total heights, additional measures of
average crown depth and average crown width were made, to the
nearest 0.5 m., with the hope that when pooled by species, these
data would aid with rough allometric equations relating typical
closed-canopy crown geometry relative to DBH and total height.</para><para><emphasis>* SHRUB DATA</emphasis></para><para>Those woody species having a typical clumped/clustered
distribution of stems sprouting out of a common rootstock with
multiple forks and a twisted-sprawling-bushy shape that rarely
exceeds 3-5m in height were considered to exhibit a typical &quot;shrub&quot;
growth form; namely: Myrica cerifera, Baccharis halmifolia, and Iva
frutescens. The azimuth and distance from plot center refer to the
approximate center of the shrub clump and/or to the largest stem in
the cluster (often the same thing). To qualify for inclusion in the
stem mapped dataset, at least one stem in the shrub clump had to
reach at least 2.5 cm at DBH (diameter at breast height, 1.37 m),
the same cutoff for &quot;tree&quot; growth forms. However, instead of
diameter at breast height, the basal diameter (BSD, taken
immediately above the root collar) of the largest stem was measured
to the nearest 0.1 cm. The maximum height of the shrub clump was
estimated to the nearest 0.5m. the same way tree height was
measured.</para><para>The same condition codes as those for trees (1-8) were used for
shrubs except that all live shrubs in good condition were coded as
&quot;2&quot; and never as code &quot;1&quot;. Again, only shrub clumps with live stems
had further measurements done on them. New previously untagged
shrub clumps with at least one stem attaining 2.5cm or greater at
breast height (1.37m) were tagged and location data recorded. For
preexisting tagged clumps, azimuths and distances were only
corrected as needed. In cases where the shrub clump was previously
tagged and many of the stems were still alive but the previously
largest stem had since died, the shrub clump was considered to
still be alive but the largest remaining stem&apos;s BSD was recorded,
the old tag moved and nailed to the new largest stem, and this
&quot;moving&quot; noted in the remarks.</para><para>In addition to BSD and height, a tally of the number of stems at
breast height falling into each of five size classes was made:
&lt;3cm, 3-6cm, 6-9cm, 9-12cm, and &gt;12cm. These tallied stems
could either originate from the rootstock or fork off of a larger
aboveground stem, but minor small mostly lateral branches on larger
stems were excluded.</para><para><emphasis>* LANDCOVER CLASS AGGREGATION DATA</emphasis></para><para>To gauge the effect of spatial scale and aggregation on
remotely-sensed land cover classifications across such locally
heterogeneous and patchy ecosystems as barrier islands, data was
collected inside and outside each plot in the four cardinal
directions at set distances outward from plot center (0, 7.5, 15,
30, and 60 m) as to what the dominant woody and herbaceous canopy
components were as well as the woody and herbaceous canopy heights.
The dominant two species in terms of overhead tree/shrub canopy (in
a subjective 2-3m radius zone) and herbaceous canopy (1 m radius)
around the collection point was recorded as well as the average
height of the primary dominant. The cover types were classified as
being one of thirteen types: 1) low salt marsh, 2) upper salt
marsh, 3) salt hay meadow [brackish-fresh marsh dominated by
Spartina patens and/or Distichlis spicata], 4)reedy or scrub marsh
[dominated by Phragmites, Typha, Juncus, or Iva], 5) evergreen
conifer forest, 6) evergreen broadleaf forest, 7) deciduous
broadleaf forest, 8) shrubland [mostly Myrica and/or Baccharis with
varying amounts of Smilax briers], 9) beach/dune exposed sparsely
vegetated sand, 10) open water, 11) upland or dune grassland, 12)
mixed forest types, or 14) mudflat [with or without wrack]. The
nine samples from within the permanent plot (0, 7.5, and 15 m
distances) can be compared to the stem map of nearby trees and
shrubs of different sizes to work out a more quantified description
of just what constituted each forest or shrubland type.</para><para><emphasis>* SUBPLOT DATA</emphasis></para><para>Subplots coordinates DO NOT MATCH the same coordinates from
1992-1993, but were once again chosen from a list of random
azimuths and distances designed not to over sample the central
portion of radial plots. When a tidal creek was present within 10
or 20 m of the subplot, the distance ( in m) to the creek was
noted. The identity of major herbaceous and woody species present
in the subplot were noted (regardless of whether or not they were
sampled in the ground cover point counts).</para><para>Ceptometer readings (when instrument was operational) were
undertaken at only three heights of 20 cm and 137cm (DBH) and in
the open full sun. This differs from readings done in 1992-93 when
ceptometer readings were taken at 0,20,40,60,80,100,120,160, and
200 cm heights above ground surface. Open readings were collected
from nearby outside the plot locations when vegetation canopy
height in the subplot exceeded 2m., or else from fully within a
large sunfleck or canopy gap if it was too difficult to get beyond
the forest or shrub canopy within a reasonable amount of time. Time
of day and weather conditions were noted. Ceptometer readings were
collected during the initial site visit regardless of weather and
time of day because of logistical limits that prevented collection
during only optimal conditions (in this way similar to initial
1992-93 readings).</para><para>Ground cover point counts were collected at each subplot in a
method similar but not identical to that used in 1992-93. Whereas
in 1992-93 a 2m-long pole with holes every 20cm was laid radially
and tangentially across the subplot in a &quot;+&quot; pattern (thus skipping
the duplicated center hole for a total of 20 points), two methods
of making the counts were used in 1996, utilizing the 50x50cm (1/4
m2) quadrats used for biomass clipping samples which had been
marked 5 times spaced 10 cm apart on each side, for a total of 20
points. By setting down the quadrat in opposite corners so its
sides were arranged radially and tangentially, a 1m across &quot;+&quot;
pattern thru the subplot center (50cm on each side of the subplot
center) that duplicated the 1992-93 pattern was created and
sampled, albeit covering a 1 m2 footprint rather than the original
4 m2 footprint. This was the &quot;subplot-outer&quot; pattern. Additionally,
to correspond to with the biomass clippings being collected, a
&quot;subplot-inner&quot; pattern was sampled wherein the 50x50 cm quadrat
was centered over the subplot (thus only a 0.25 m2 footprint) and
all 20 points were tallied. In all cases, directly under/over each
sample mark, the identity of the vegetation (if any) was noted with
preference being given to the overlying vegetation if more than one
species&apos; leaves overlapped. The ground cover thus counted was NOT
identified to species but rather to growth-form category: 1)
grasses, 2) rushes &amp; reeds (includes Phragmites), 3) vines, 4)
woody tree saplings/seedlings or shrubs, 5) miscellaneous
herbaceous plants, 6) bare ground, or 7) standing water. The
average height of the plants in each category was measured to the
nearest 5 cm.</para><para><emphasis>* CLIP PLOTS within the SUBPLOTS</emphasis></para><para>At each subplot, a density plot/clip plot was undertaken to
sample the standing biomass of the species present in the
herbaceous layer. This also included sampling the biomass of shrubs
and tree seedlings that would not be otherwise sampled using the
stem map criteria, usually just the leaves and twigs of those
shrubs or trees (but not main supporting stems) that lay over the
clip plot but below 1.37m breast height. The density plot /clip
plot was centered overtop the center of the subplot using a PVC
quadrat. The size of the square quadrat used depended upon the
density of the vegetation, with smaller quadrats being used for
denser vegetation like mats of S. patens and D. spicata. The sizes
of quadrats used were 50x50cm (0.25 m2), 25x25cm (0.125 m2), or
12.5x12.5cm (0.0625 m2). Usually the sizes of the density and clip
plots were identical.</para><para>Within each density plot, the mean height of each species being
sampled was measured to the nearest 5 or 10 cm. In some cases,
additional measures were made of the number of live and dead stems
within the density plot or of the number of leaves within either
the full density plot or just on the four stems closest to the four
quadrat center-side marks. Then the vegetation in the clip plot was
clipped and brought back to the lab where it was sorted into live
(green) or dead (brown or senescent) fractions, sometimes into stem
vs. leaf vs. fruit fractions as well, and then dried in a drying
oven overnight or until the weight stabilized, at which time the
live or dead dry weights were measured to the nearest 0.01g.</para><para><emphasis>* CALIBRATING CLIP PLOTS with GROWING SEASON TRENDS</emphasis></para><para>To calibrate growth of the herbaceous layer over the field
season in order to compare plots with diminished temporal noise,
six salt marsh plots (200,201,205,206,214,111), four brackish marsh
plots (44,68,72, and part of 112), and two upland plots (39 and
part of 112) were surveyed early in the field season and again
every one to two months as manpower allowed. Not every plot from
this subset was revisited during every calibration session,
although this was attempted. Methods in the salt marsh plots varied
from the others (both calibration and &quot;normal&quot; survey methods) in
that Spartina alterniflora stems were tagged with bird bands and
tracked individually, measuring height and number of live and dead
leaves (and for a select few stems [every fifth], the linear
lengths of the live green and senescent brown portions of each
leaf) but were not destructively harvested for standing biomass.
Instead, 15 randomly selected stems spanning the range of observed
stem heights were measured and harvested from within the plot but
outside the subplots, dried, and weighed to generate data for
creating height:biomass allometric equations to be used to
calculate biomass and NPP of those salt marsh subplots. For the
repeated brackish and upland calibration subset of plots, the
&quot;normal&quot; destructive biomass clipping was performed adjacent to the
clipped quadrats from previous clipping sessions.</para><para>* BIOMASS:LAI CLIPPING SUBSET of CLIP PLOT data</para><para>In order to be able to convert foliar biomass into leaf area, a
subset of the harvested clip plot samples was used. For three shrub
species (BCCHLM, IVAFRT, and MYRCRF), a herbaceous &quot;nettle&quot;
species, two sedges (SCRAMR and SCRRBS), and one salt marsh grass
(SPRALT), a subset of the live leaf fraction from the clip plot was
set aside. Along with certain standard reference objects (US
dollars and coins, a credit card, and a playing card) used to
correct for potential photocopier distortion due to scaling
changes, the leaves of these subsamples were first photocopied
before being dried and weighed. The photocopied pages were then
scanned into a computer and the area of the leaves determined using
the methodology of O&apos;Neal, Landis, and Isaacs (2002. An inexpensive
accurate method for measuring leaf area and defoliation through
digital image analysis. Journal of Economic Entomology 95 (6):
1190-1194.) with the following modifications: 1.) the leaves were
photocopied and the photocopies scanned into a computer rather than
scanning the leaves directly; 2.) contrast-stretching and modifying
of the gray-scale curves to create a pure black-and-white image was
done in Adobe Photoshop rather than within the Scion Image program
used to conduct the measurements; and 3.) a horizontal:vertical
pixel aspect ratio of 0.996 in conjunction with an overall
correction factor of 1.0232 was applied to the measured leaf areas
to correct for very slight reductions in size by the photocopier.
Average post-correction accuracy for the standards was within +-
0.5% of the known area, which was also within 1 SE of the mean.
This is all within the larger rough estimate of +- 2-3 % error due
to incompletely removed shadows and pixelated leaf outlines.</para></section><section><title>NOTES:</title><para>Field data was collected between 3 June 1996 and 12 October
1996. The field crew was reduced from 3 to 1 person on 10 August.
From mid August to mid September bad weather including 2 hurricanes
prevented most trips to the island. Boat engine trouble on 12
October effectively ended the field season 2 days early.</para><para>Of the original 100 permanent vegetation monitoring plots
installed on Parramore Island during the winter and spring of 1993,
95 were revisited and resurveyed. 13 new plots were installed in
the low and upper salt marsh areas that had been under-represented
previously. Of the remaining original five, #50 was disturbed and
half cut down and cleared out due to its close proximity to the
house at Clubhouse Creek during TNC renovations; #10 was completely
obscured and all access cut off by draping rolling blankets of
greenbriers (Smilax species) even more so than when installed in
1993; #11 was completely obscured and hidden within encroaching
Phragmites communis stands that now encompass the entire northern
marsh in that area; #24 was completely obscured and hidden within
the vast narrow-leaf cattail (Typha angustifolia) community that
surrounds North Pond and cut off line of sight to all noted
location landmarks; and #74 was found but we were unable to return
to survey it due to delays caused by weather and boat failure.</para><para>Two plots at the south tip of Parramore, #150 and #153, had been
lost to storms in the spring of 1993 that lowered the elevation
from being beach to tidal overwash flats and opened up a new inlet
into the Swash channel. Their exact previous locations could not be
pinpointed from the ground (maybe a 1996 air photo could be used to
determine in water, sand, or new marsh occupies those sites). So 2
new replacement plots #207 and #208 respectively were installed in
approximately the same locations; however, the center stakes for
these too were wiped out during the four hurricane storm events
that affected the shore this summer (Bertha, Eduoard, Fran, and the
nor&apos;easter remains of Josephine). Plot #207 remains mostly beach as
of 12 October 1996, but its fringing marsh is half buried and is
behind another 102 m. of beach before the water&apos;s edge. Plot #208
as of 12 October 1996 is now a tidal outlet that helps drain the
waters between south Parramore and Crescent Islands.</para><para>The new salt marsh plots are #s 200, 201, 205, 206, 209, 212,
213, 214, 215, 216, 217, 218, and 225. Approximate locations are
marked on the field maps included with the data sheets as well as
coordinates located from off air photos, plus descriptions of the
locations via triangulation from visible landmarks are described
for each plot with its plot data file. Although though planned, due
to manpower shortages no permanent plot data was collected on the
experimental pimples (even though center stakes were
installed).</para><para>The Sunfleck ceptometer used to collect PAR readings ceased
functioning and was not repaired prior to the end of the resurvey
effort. Thus only plots surveyed during the first five weeks of so,
principally along Italian Ridge and northern Parramore near the
USGS station and northern dune field have ceptometer readings.</para><para>Not all clip plot herbaceous samples could be processed in the
lab during the field season after the crew was reduced from 3 to 1
person. This occurred because the time split increased to about 1:1
field:lab time as more marsh plots were done per day later in the
season, and as priority was in finishing site visits first. Many
samples at the end of the resurvey effort were brought back and
frozen awaiting drying and weighing, particularly for the subplot
fraction of salthay (Spartina patens and Distichlis spicata) as
well as the 4th session Spartina alterniflora calibration stems
from plots #200 and #201. Unfortunately, due to subsequent storm
damage to the lab (power failure and basement flooding), these
samples decomposed or were lost and their data remains incomplete.<emphasis>This section contains a progress report on the general

center stakes. In the absence of a located center stake (such as
when redox reactions in the marsh soil and saline tidal flooding
corroded and toppled the rebar stake), the center was relocated by
triangulating from tagged trees and shrubs (if present) or from
locator landmarks coupled with the original plot maps (location
relative to canopy gaps or vegetation zonation patterns). A new
center stake was installed or at least marked with flagging if the
old stake was not found. The location of new plots was described as
before. New low and upper salt marsh plots were not located
entirely randomly as were previous upland and fresh and brackish
marsh plots; they were chosen in a stratified-random pattern of
paired creek-side and marsh-interior plots along tidal creeks that
allowed boat access. The marsh-interior plots were located 50-100m
distant at random azimuth (but on same side of access creek) from
the creek-side plots.</para><para>GPS coordinates were recorded to the nearest 1/100th of a minute
accuracy when there was sufficient signal strength (but this data
should be supplanted by the 2002 Post-fire GPS coordinate data
where available).</para><para>All plots are 1/12th ha radial plots with a radius of 16.3 m.
For the full plot, all tree stems and shrub clumps &gt;2.5cm DBH
were mapped, tagged, and measured for DBH and height. Each plot
contains 3-6 (usually 5) subplots for sampling the herbaceous
ground cover and LAI. Each subplot was randomly located except that
an effort was made so that all the subplots were not clustered in
the same quarter or half of any plot.</para><para>Anytime that species-id codes were used to identify the
vegetation being measured, these IDs match those from the
VCR-LTER&apos;s list of SPECID codes (based on the first letter of Genus
and next two consonants then first letter of species and next two
consonants). If something was only IDed to genus, then XXX was
filled in for the last three letters of the species code (ex.
SMLXXX for Smilax spp.). For some mixes of species a common-form
name was used, such as &quot;grass&quot; for any mix of unidentified
combination of upland grass species, &quot;herb&quot; for unknown herbaceous
species, or &quot;salthay&quot; for a mix in various proportions of Spartina
patens and Distichilis spicata.</para></section></section></description></methodStep></methods><project scope="document"><title>Parramore Permanent Plot Project</title><personnel scope="document"><individualName><givenName>John</givenName><surName>Porter</surName></individualName><address scope="document"><deliveryPoint>UVA, Department of Environmental Sciences, 291 McCormick Road, P.O.
