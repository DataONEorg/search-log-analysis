    <abstract>
      <para>
  In 1998, formal demographic censusing of wild ginseng (<emphasis>Panax
  quinquefolius</emphasis> L.) populations was initiated in West
  Virginia. By 2004, thirty populations had been added to the census
  effort, spanning seven states (IN-2, KY-6, MD-1, NY-2, PA-2, VA-5,
  WV-12) and a wide variety of land use histories and eastern deciduous
  forest communities. The censusing effort continued without
  interruption at all populations until June, 2016. Annually, each
  population was visited twice. The first visit generally occurred
  between late May and the end of June. The second visit generally
  occurred in the first three weeks of August. The purpose of the spring
  census was to assess the population status at the time of year when
  the largest number of individuals were visible aboveground
  (post-germination, prior to substantial losses due to browsing and
  other causes). Detailed measures of plant size were made, with an
  emphasis on total leaf area calculation. In addition, a variety of
  plant condition notations were made, with the ultimate goal of
  determining mortality and recruitment in the population, as well as
  individual size transitions. The primary purpose of the second census
  each year was to assess seed production on each plant. In addition,
  further notations of plant condition were made to assess changes over
  the growing season. To maintain methodological consistency with field
  personnel turnover, the lead author participated in fieldwork
  throughout the study, visiting each population at least once every two
  years. In addition, after being trained themselves, graduate students
  trained undergraduate conservation interns to assure consistent
  methods were used each year. The data are suitable for demographic
  modeling, and the unique spatial and temporal extent allow the
  exploration of important questions about variability in population
  growth and viability of ginseng, America’s premiere wild harvested
  medicinal plant.

        <description>
          <para>
  Population definition: We defined a population as any grouping of
  plants that was at least 100 meters away from any other such grouping.
  In most cases, we tried to find and mark every individual in the
  population, although in two unusual cases the population seemed to
  extend so far that censusing would be impractical. All were located
  within plots of land less than 4 ha in size; most of them were much
  smaller than that. The distance of 100 meters to separate populations
  was based on observations of pollinator movements (small bees and
  flies) as well as an early experiment in which we showed a fall-off in
  seed production around 50 meters away from a central pollen source.
  This suggested that pollinators were less effective at dispersing
  pollen when distances between plants were that large. The third piece
  of ‘gene flow’ information came from recent studies of bird dispersal,
  showing that seeds would be dispersed as far as 100 meters only
  extremely rarely by the main bird dispersers of ginseng seeds
  (thrushes).
</para>
          <para>
  Locating and selecting populations: We censused our 30 populations
  every year to accumulate data about every individual. Once ginseng was
  found at a site, we attempted to locate every individual ginseng
  plant. This involved teams of 5 or 6 trained ginseng spotters arrayed
  in a line with about 5 m between each person, then slowly walking in
  tandem across the slope, flagging every plant that was found. When we
  had gone 100 m without seeing a plant, the line of spotters reversed
  course and walked a new transect back across the population, flagging
  plants. This process was repeated until we were convinced we had
  flagged every visible plant in the population.
</para>
          <para>
  Marking populations and individuals: Each population was marked with a
  GPS coordinate (Global Positioning System) at a convenient start point
  to facilitate returning to the vicinity of the population. To
  facilitate re-finding individual plants, we devised a method involving
  ‘phototrails’. Starting at a prominent visible and semi-permanent
  object (usually a rock or tree) on one edge of the population, we took
  a compass bearing toward the first flag, captured an image of the
  path, and paced out a rough distance to the flag. A second image was
  taken from 2-4 m from the flag, and often a third close-up image was
  taken showing the individual plant with its local surroundings. This
  process was repeated, proceeding from flag to flag, or from local
  fixed points to flags through the entire population. Later, these
  photos were printed and placed in notebooks that were utilized in
  future visits to re-locate each plant. In tight clusters of more than
  4-5 plants, local directions were supplemented with cluster maps that
  included permanent objects for orientation as well as marked positions
  of numbered plants relative to each other.
</para>
          <para>
  Since ginseng is harvested, we did not want to call attention to our
  plants with a visible tag. We therefore used aluminum roofing nails
  with a number etched in the broad head of the nail to serve as
  markers. The nails were placed at the base of each plant next to the
  rhizome where the stalk emerged each spring. Each plant was given a
  unique number.
</para>
          <para>
  As new seedlings were discovered, new numbers were assigned and they
  were followed through time. When a plant died, its number was retired
  and not re-used to keep future identifications clear. If we discovered
  a new plant that was somehow missed in the initial census, we added it
  to the population and to the phototrail so we could have as complete
  an accounting as possible.
</para>
          <para>
  Spring census: We determined that leaves would be fully expanded and
  stalks fully extended by the third week in May in most years. At the
  same time, few plants would be browsed by deer or damaged by other
  animals or events prior to that time (although it was possible). Also,
  new seedlings generally had emerged by then. Therefore, we censused
  the plants starting in the fourth week of May; by then, the plants had
  stopped growing, but we would be able to census almost all the plants
  in the population. Each year census teams started with the lower
  elevation, western and southern populations, and progressed to higher
  elevations and more northern populations as the census continued. Each
  spring census was carried out by two field crews of three people,
  every year of the study. We measured or noted the following attributes
  of each plant in the spring census: (1) Presence, (2) Leaf number, (3)
  Leaflet arrangement of each leaf (ginseng leaves have between 1 and 7
  leaflets), (4) Height of the stalk from ground to the point where the
  leaves branch from the stalk, (5) Lengths and widths of the longest
  leaflet on each leaf (this was used to estimate leaf area, later), (6)
  Reproductive status (had an inflorescence, or not), (7) Deer browse
  status, (8) Disease evidence, (9) Insect damage, (10) Frost damage,
  (11) Any other miscellaneous traits. If a plant was absent, we
  searched for evidence of harvest. In addition, if the identifying nail
  was missing, we would note that the nail needed to be replaced. If a
  new plant or new seedling was found, it was added to the phototrail
  and/or cluster map, and to the data set.
</para>
          <para>
  Fall census: The main purpose of the fall census was to assess seed
  production. The census was timed to ensure that all seeds that would
  be dispersed that year were far enough along to be counted, but not so
  late that dispersal had already occurred. This meant that ‘fall’
  censuses were typically carried out in the first 3 weeks of August,
  with the order of censusing in parallel with berry phenology. Ginseng
  berries contain 1, 2, or 3 seeds and it is easy to count them from the
  distinct bulges on the fruit. Most adult ginseng plants do not produce
  seeds every year, though they are capable of it. At the fall census,
  we also noted the color of each berry on the plant. In addition, we
  noted any new evidence of deer browse, disease, insect damage,
  harvest, senescence, or other traits of the plant.
</para>
          <para>
  Every effort was made at both census times to minimize the effect of
  our census on surrounding vegetation to keep interspecific competition
  unaltered.

          <attributeName>id</attributeName>
          <attributeDefinition>ID is the number inscribed on aluminum marking nail. Should be unique for every individual within a population.  Note: sometimes there is a decimal after the number (e.g. there might be a 150 and a 150.1).  150.1 could be a vegetative sprout off 150.  Or it could be that 150 was used inadvertently twice in the population and to differentiate them we gave the second one a new number and tag (150.1) to make it unique.  See the persistence category below to see how vegetative sprouts are designated and distinguished from unique plants.  Vegetative sprouts are uncommon often appearing for a year or a few years then disappearing.  They are formed from new vegetative buds on second or sometimes third storage roots belowground.  Note: nails could be lost due to soil erosion or sinking deep in the soil or collection by animals or disturbance by harvesters; in these cases the ID was inferred based on location notes past size characteristics and cluster map locations.  Plants were re-marked at the earliest census following missing nail notation.</attributeDefinition>

Stalk height also means something different for 1 leaf plants because there is no obvious node or branch point.

          <attributeDefinition>Observed Leaf Area.  This was based on the following regression equation: Leaf Area=-49.66435+(6.8707463*LLL)+(12.626819*WLL)+((1.9621791*(LLL-7.512)*(WLL-3.637)).  Multiple regression equation coefficients determined by least squares regression using SAS JMP. r2&gt;0.95.  Note; this equation predicts the area of a single leaf, based on largest leaflet dimensions.  Observed leaf area is the summation of individual leaf areas across all leaves of the plant.  We have considered this the best measure of overall plant size, though others could be devised.</attributeDefinition>

          <attributeName>inf_la</attributeName>
          <attributeDefinition>Inferred Leaf Area. Equal to Observed leaf area for a plant present at spring census.  A placeholder for dormant plants that are not dead.  We filled in the previously measured leaf area when the aboveground portion of a plant was gone prior to our arrival in the spring census.  Actual leaf area may have been less or greater than this.  Typically it would have been slightly greater, however the following year, due to loss of carbon gain for the year, leaf area often declines.  The placeholder assumption of a leaf area equal to the prior measured area is a compromise in the absence of other information.  Other assumptions could be made (e.g., expected size based on growth curves of unbrowsed plants, or halfway between year t-1 and year t+1, assuming the plant re-appears in the following spring).  Using inferred leaf area allows one to place a plant into a non-zero size class even though it was not measured in that year.</attributeDefinition>

          <attributeName>persistence</attributeName>
          <attributeDefinition>Persistence Classes. All persistence classes other than DEAD are considered LIVE plants (a new column could be added to reflect this).  However, within the LIVE group, several categories were noted to assist efforts to use the data for demographic work.  Further detailed explanations of each persistence class are described in footnotes below the table, and below (for DEAD and NS).  Details of a declaration of DEAD are given here because it is such an important class demographically, and it can be difficult to determine for a plant with a perennial root, but deciduous aboveground: Death of a plant was inferred from long-term absence from the population, but the length of time required was a function of plant size/stage.  If a plant was a new seedling in the prior year, but was missing by the fall census of that first year, when it was absent in the spring census it was declared DEAD.  For a 1-leaf plant that was not a new seedling, it was only designated DEAD if missing the fall of 2 years prior AND the prior spring.  A 2-leaf plant was declared DEAD if it was MIA S for two seasons in a row prior to the current census. A 3-leaf or larger plant was declared DEAD if it was missing in the fall three seasons ago, then MIA S for two consecutive seasons before the current census.  In the final census season for most populations (2016), we dug near tags where 3-leaf plants were found to search for evidence the root was still alive.  If not found, the plant was declared dead after two seasons.  These criteria mean that a complete and reliable determination of DEAD was possible only up to and including the 2014 season.  In 2015 and 2016 seasons, some MIA S individuals will be declared DEAD in the future, but have not been declared that by the end of the census.  This needs to be accounted for in demographic modeling efforts that include the 2015 and 2016 seasons. Details of the NS classification are given here because it is also a very important class demographically.  NS stands for New Seedling.  The majority of new seedlings emerged prior to spring census, although we concluded after many years of censusing that it was possible for a low frequency of germination to occur between spring and fall census (these were added to the NS listing for the year).  We defined new seedlings as 1-leaf plants in their first year, and as such they were recognized based on presence of at least three of five criteria; 1) presence of a seed coat still attached to the plant (very common),  2) lack of an obvious node along the stalk (this is the place where a second leaf would branch off if the plant had two leaves, and is generally present after year 1), 3) presence of a small diameter, white root below the seed coat  4) a narrow central leaflet (large length:width ratio), and  5) lack of a tag or presence in the existing database in the population.  NS were recorded as such if they were within 2 m of any existing plant in the database.  Based on prior experimental work on post-dispersal seed movements, we concluded that by censusing this area around each plant in the population, we successfully detected 90 percent of the existing new recruits.  Fertility figures in demographic work can be adjusted (upward) to account for the missing 10 percent of NS not censused.  Later work also suggested that relevant to this adjustment is the occasional dispersal of seeds by thrushes.  A high and active fall thrush population would be expected to increase the proportion of seeds not accounted for by this census method. MIA S is a designation used at spring census whether or not there was evidence of deer browse. In either event, the aboveground leaves were not present and could not be measured to yhield as leaf area measurement. MIA F is a designation meaning present in the spring but missing by fall census.</attributeDefinition>
