            <abstract>The U.S. Geological Survey's Upper Midwest Environmental Sciences Center (UMESC) has obtained historical photography of the Upper Mississippi River, collected by the Corps of Engineers. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's (FWS) Upper Mississippi National Wildlife and Fish Refuge contracted the Upper Midwest Environmental Sciences Center (UMESC) to scan and georeference the 1954 images for lower Pool 8, to create reference images for use in geographic information system (GIS).  These data are also distributed through the UMESC Web site, so others can also access the data.</abstract>
            <purpose>The Upper Midwest Environmental Sciences Center administers the Long Term Resource Monitoring Program (LTRMP), authorized under the Water Resources Development Act of 1986 (Public Law 99-662).  The mission of the LTRMP is to provide decision-makers with information to maintain the Upper Mississippi River System (UMRS) as a viable large river ecosystem given its multiple-use character.  The long-term goals of the Program are to understand the system, determine resource trends and impacts, develop management alternatives, manage information, and develop useful products.  The collection and distribution of high-resolution aerial photography aids the Center in meeting these goals.</purpose>
            <supplinf>To make the data easier to download, the photo mosaic has been compressed and is being served as a georeferenced MrSid image.  A software program that contains MrSid image support or a MrSid image viewer is required to view these data.  A free image viewer capable of subsetting, resampling, and exporting the compressed image to georeferenced TIFF image (a .tif image and a .tfw world file) is available at http://www.lizardtech.com/.  The data are stored in a Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) projection, zone 15.  Two datum options are available, North American Datum 1927 (NAD27) and North American Datum 1983 (NAD83).</supplinf>

The photos were scanned using a 200 dots per inch (dpi) image resolution, and the files were saved as TIFF images.  The photo image was assigned a name that described the photo's (1) flight line, (2) photo number, (3) the year in which the photo was collected, and (4) a distinction between true color and color infrared.</procdesc>
