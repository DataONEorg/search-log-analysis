The purpose of this dataset is to act as a conduit by which animal telemetry data, ideas, analysis and statistical tools may be shared between interested parties throughout Australasia.  

The animal telemetry projects collated in this datasets have been collated from peer-reviewed scientific papers published between 2000 and 2013. This represents the first-step in the creation of an Australasian focused database for animal telemetry research and management projects.  If you have undertaken an telemetry project and it is not listed here, whether the study findings have been published or not, then please fill in the project submission form. The details will be incorporated into the portal.  All project meta-data entered into this site will be searchable and accessible via the portal as well as through The Australian National Data Service.</para>

<para>An electronic database search via Web of Knowledge (WOK) and Web of Science (WOS) was used to locate biotelemetry studies published in peer-reviewed scientific journals. Selected publications were restricted to papers published between the years 2000 &#8211; 2012 conducted within Australasia. The Australasian region included in the study were: Australia, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands and New Caledonia. Key word searches were conducted using combinations of 30 terms such as biotelemetry, radiotelemetry, acoustic telemetry, ARGOS, and GPS satellite. Papers utilising any form of electronic telemetry technology were included in the database.</para>
