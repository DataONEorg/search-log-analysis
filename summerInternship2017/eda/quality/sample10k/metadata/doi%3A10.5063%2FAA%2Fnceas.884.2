In this region, there is one crop of rice per year, the fields are continuously flooded from transplanting to harvest, and there is heavy use of organic fertilizers, particularly pig manure.  The fields were studied under prevailing agricultural practices of the local farmers.   The results represent emissions under standard agricultural practices and the year to year variability of climate, fertilizers, available irrigation water, and cultivars.  The sample site was located near the village of Tuzu (29.5 degrees N latitude, 106.7 degrees E longitude), about 20 km east of Leshan City, and 100 km south of Chengdu.

In this study, an aluminum frame was installed in the soil at the end of the boardwalk. The frame had a low center that could be filled with water for an air-tight seal.  A rigid translucent polyethylene chamber, equipped with a sample port, is placed on the frame after the rice has been transplanted and the field is flooded. Four air samples are taken every 3 minutes, so the chamber is on the base and covering the plants for about 12 minutes.
