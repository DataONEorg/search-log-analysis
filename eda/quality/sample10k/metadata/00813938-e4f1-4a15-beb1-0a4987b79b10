      <abstract>This is polygon data of shallowest principal aquifers of
Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands, developed as
part of the effort to produce a map published at 1:500,000
in Chapter HA 730-N of the "Ground Water Atlas of the United
States" series of printed publications. See Other_Citation_Details
for publication information. The published map contains base and
cultural features not included in this data. The Ground Water
Atlas publication also includes information that may be relevant
to the use of this data, such as figures showing where an aquifer
may extend beyond the area delineated in this data, but be
overlain by one or more other aquifers and/or low-permeability
material.
			
The areal extent of the aquifers, as shown in this data, represent
the area in which a named aquifer is the shallowest of the
principal aquifers. These aquifer areas are not necessarily the
only area in which ground water can be withdrawn because the
aquifers shown may have a larger areal extent than is represented
here.  
			
The boundaries in this data generally represent an
interpretation of the surface location (outcrop), or near
surface location (shallow subcrop) of the uppermost principal
aquifer for the area. An aquifer may extend beyond the area shown
in this data, but be overlain by one or more other aquifers,
and/or low-permeability material.
			
These aquifer outcrop and shallow subcrop boundaries represent
broad, regional categories and should not be interpreted as site
specific. Comments regarding the names of aquifers, or the
hydrogeologic interpretation of the aquifers can be can be
directed to the USGS Water Resources Division, Office of Ground
Water, Roy Sonenshein, sunshine@usgs.gov, (305) 526-2895.

      <purpose>For publications, at a scale of 1:500,000 or smaller. Because of
the small scale, the primary use is for regional and national data
display rather than specific local data analysis.

      <supplinf>Introduction
This data was created as part of the effort to produce an aquifer
map published at 1:500,000 in Chapter HA 730-N of the "Ground
Water Atlas" series of printed publications. See reference for
more publication details. Since this data was created to produce a
printed map, the map can be considered the source for the data.
			
The information below is provided for more detail regarding the
map's compilation procedures. The coverages for Puerto Rico, and
the Virgin Islands were processed separately, and later appended
into one coverage. The processing steps are discussed separately
for Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands
			
PUERTO RICO
*Aquifer contact lines
The aquifer contact information was originally compiled by Robert
A. Renken at a scale of 1:250,000 on scale-stable material. The
contacts were scribed at a lineweight of 0.004". Several lat-long
intersections were also scribed for later use in georeferencing. A
film positive made from the scribecoat was scanned at a resolution
of either 300 or 400 pixels per inch (exact resolution was not
recorded). The raster image was converted to an Arc/Info grid and
vectorized using the Arcscan module with these parameters:

The resulting lines were edited in Arcedit for completeness and
vectorizing errors. Paper plots were made to compare the resulting
linework to the original compilation. Discrepancies were noted and
corrected. The low generalize tolerance used in the vectorizing
process resulted in lines that closely matched the original
compilation, but had a small vertex spacing. This small vertex
spacing would have in turn resulted in large file sizes and
an unnecessary level of detail for the intended publication scale.
			
The arcs were generalized, splined, generalized, and unsplit in
Arcedit, tolerances were not recorded. The appearance and accuracy
of the resulting linework was judged against publication standards
for the intended publication scale (1:500,000). The aquifer
contact lines were transformed into their proper projection
through the use of tic features located at several latitude-
longitude intersections included in the scribed linework. The
resulting RMS error was not recorded. The coverage was plotted and
checked against the source compilation.
			
Coastline
The coastline was derived from an Arc/info coverage received from
the USGS Water Resources Division Caribbean District in January,
1996. This coverage had been originally created from 1:20,000 USGS
maps, and subsequently modified by the Caribbean Disctrict for use
at a smaller scale. This coverage, as received contained more
detail than was needed for the intended publication scale for the
aquifer map (1:500,000). The coastline coverage was generalized
for publication purposes, and the generalized version is now part
of this data. The data linework was generalized by converting the
line coverage into a grid , with a cell spacing of 25 meters. This
grid was vectorized in Arcedit, using the Arcscan module. The
parameters for vectorizing were:

This procedure resulted in a less detailed version of the original
coastline. The resulting coastline was compared onscreen to the
original. The aquifer contact lines were snapped to, and appended with the
final coastline. Polygons were attributed in Arcedit.

VIRGIN ISLANDS
*Aquifer contact lines
The aquifer contact information was originally compiled by Robert
A. Renken at a scale of 1:100,000 on scale-stable material. The
contacts were scribed at a lineweight of 0.006". Several lat-long
intersections were also scribed for later use in georeferencing. A
film positive made from the scribecoat was scanned at a resolution
of of either 300 or 400 pixels per inch (exact resolution was not
recorded). The raster image was converted to an Arc/Info grid and
vectorized using the Arcscan module with these parameters:

Coastline
The coastline was derived from coverages originally digitized from
1:24,000 USGS maps, as received from the USGS Water Resources
Division Caribbean District in early 1992. These coverages
contained more detail than was needed for the intended publication
scale for the aquifer map (1:500,000). The coverages were
appended, and edited to contain only coastline information. 
			
The coastline coverage was generalized for publication purposes, and
the generalized version is now part of this data. The data
linework was first generalized to a level of detail subjectively
considered appropriate for display at a scale of 1:250,000. This
was done by converting the line coverage into an Arc/Info grid,
cell spacing unrecorded. This grid was vectorized in Arcedit,
using the Arcscan module. The parameters for vectorizing were:

This procedure resulted in a less detailed version of the original
coastline. This coastline was used in an intermediate compilation
step, and was further generalized for publication at 1:500,000.
The further generalization presumably included the use of the
Arcedit generalize command, as well as on-screen editing, and use
of cartographic judgement, however, records were not kept. The
resulting coastline was compared onscreen to the original. The
aquifer contact lines were snapped to, and appended with the final
coastline. Polygons were attributed in Arcedit.
			
The Puerto Rico, and Virgin Islands coverages were appended to
create one coverage. The coverage was used to generate an output
file that was imported by Adobe Illustrator for map publication.
The completed map, at a scale of 1:500,000, was reviewed for
content and accuracy by the Ground Water Atlas HA 730-N lead
cartographer, Water Resources Division Geohydrologic Map Editor,
and chapter author.

a.) Aquifer names and all or part of the outcrop line shown on the Nationwide 'Principal Aquifer' map (Miller, James A., 1998), were used with the extent of each aquifer from the various chapters of the 'Ground Water Atlas of the United States' to create this coverage. The largest scale map source available was used. Where the line defining the aquifer extent is the same as the outcrop, the data were copied from the Principal Aquifers data set. Otherwise data were traced from 1:7,500,000, 1:5,000,000, or 1:2,500,000 scale map sources onto a stable base material. Where the extent was defined by a coastline, the 1:2,000,000scale Hydrography Features of the U.S. was used. (The following steps were done using ARC/INFO 7.2.1 on Data General AViiON UNIX. Much of the terminology used will be specific to ARC/INFO). 
				
b.) The aquifer extent lines were digitized into ARCEDIT using standard USGStolerances. After digitizing, a check plot was created and reviewed against the traced map. If a line was located more than a line weight (0.05") from the digitized source, it was corrected during an ARCEDIT session. 
				
c.) Using the TRANSFORM command, the coverage containing the digitized, aquifer extent lines was combined with the coverage containing registration tics, was rubbersheeted from geographic to Albers EqualArea Conic projection. An RMS error of less than 0.004 was accepted. If it was greater than 0.004 the location and values of the lat/long points were verified. Following this transformation, any aquifer lines from the aquifer extent coverage coincidental to aquifer lines from the 'Principal Aquifers' map data set were copied from the 'Principal Aquifers' map data set and put into the aquifer extent coverage. The aquifer extent coverage was cleaned, the topology was built, and labels were added. 
				
d.) Four items were added to the .PAT file: 
AQ_NAME (60 65 C) 
AQ_CODE (4 5 I), 
ROCK_NAME (40 45 C), 
ROCK_TYPE (4 5 I). 
ROCK_NAME comes from the Principal Aquifers Data set, 1998. 
				
The first digit of the three digit aq_code, refers to aquifer lithology. 
100 series are numbers for unconsolidated sand and gravel aquifers 
200 series are numbers for semiconsolidated sand aquifers 
300 series are numbers for sandstone aquifers 
400 series are numbers for carbonate-rock aquifers 
500 series are numbers for sandstone and carbonate-rock aquifers 
600 series are numbers for volcanic-rock aquifers 
999 is given for non aquifer islands inside aquifer polygons 
			
e.) The following items were verified: 
--Digitizing RMS error (below 0.005) 
--Transformation RMS error (below 0.004) 
--Arcs match the traced mylar (no gaps between the plot and the compilation) 
--Arc and polygon topology exists 
--Coverage has a coordinate system defined 
--Attributes aq_name and aq_code have been added and populated correctly 
--Necessary files exist to redo any step</procdesc>
        <procdate>19970331</procdate>
      </procstep>
      <procstep>
        <procdesc>This step was done on an NT workstation. After plotting the extent at 1:2,000,000, the lines were checked with the documented sources. If needed, the lines were corrected to better represent the source data. This process may have included one or more of the following steps: Reshaping the arc Replacing the arc from the outcrop data, --Digitizing new lines polygons --Deleting polygons.</procdesc>
        <procdate>19991118</procdate>
      </procstep>
      <procstep>
        <procdesc>Due to a computer problem final corrected files were lost, however hard copy plots of those files were retained. This file was recreated from those plots using a similar process to that described above. Where extent lines were equal to the outcrop, data were extracted from the Principal Aquifers Data Set. Otherwise data were digitized from the retained hard copy plots using the same tolerances and software described above. A check plot was created and compared to the hard copy plot. Significant deviations, greater than approximately a line weight (0.005), were corrected using ARCEDIT. Data were reviewed internally to assure compliance with original sources.</procdesc>
