      <abstract>The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), in cooperation with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (CT DEEP), is producing detailed geologic maps of the coastal sea floor. Bathymetry and sidescan-sonar imagery, originally collected by NOAA for charting purposes, provide a fundamental framework for research and management activities in Long Island Sound, shows the composition and terrain of the seabed, and provides information on sediment transport and benthic habitat. During April-May 2009 NOAA completed hydrographic survey H12013 offshore of the entrance to the Connecticut River, and during November 2009 and April 2010 bottom photographs and surficial sediment data were acquired as part of two ground-truth reconnaissance surveys of this area. Two interpretive data layers were derived from the multibeam echo-sounder and the ground-truth data used to verify them. For more information on the ground-truth surveys see: http://woodshole.er.usgs.gov/operations/ia/public_ds_info.php?fa=2009-059-FA and http://woodshole.er.usgs.gov/operations/ia/public_ds_info.php?fa=2010-010-FA</abstract>
      <purpose>The purpose of this dataset is to release the mid-resolution and full-resolution JPEG images of photographs of the sea floor acquired off the entrance to the Connecticut River in eastern Long Island Sound, with a SEABOSS system during USGS surveys 2009-059-FA and 2010-010-FA conducted aboard the RV Rafael during November 2009 and April 2010. These photographs can be used to provide information on surface geology, sedimentary processes, and habitats.</purpose>

    <complete>All images of the sea floor collected within the study area off the entrance to the Connecticut River in eastern Long Island Sound, on cruises 2009-059-FA and 2010-015-FA with the Mini SEABOSS system are included. Total station numbers range from OL1 to OL19, but no photographs were acquired at stations OL12 (skipped due to weather) and OL14 (high turbidity prevented visibility). Not all of the photos collected on the cruises were collected within the study area.</complete>

        <srccontr>The Mini SEABOSS was designed specifically for the USGS Woods Hole Science Center's 26-foot research vessel Rafael. This system is equipped with two video cameras, a digital still camera, and a van Veen grab sampler. This system, weighing approximately 200 lbs, can be used to depths up to 40 meters. The grab itself is raised and lowered with a 3/16-inch Aramid fiber winch-line with a breaking strength of 5,600 pounds. The davit is secured when the Mini SEABOSS is in the water. The electrical cable is on a spring-wound take-up reel with electrical slip rings that is mounted aft of the sampler. This arrangement protects the 0.38-in. multi-conductor cable and keeps the Mini SEABOSS correctly oriented with the boat. This multi-conductor cable enables communication between the ship's lab and the Mini SEABOSS system. The digital camera, a Minolta Dimage 7Hi, is mounted in a machined Delrin housing with a flat port and is set for 2560 x 1920 pixel images at the "fine" setting for compression. This allows the camera to be used for over 200 images with a 1 GB Compact Flash card without downloading. The system also has a 50 Watt/second flash unit powered by 8 AA batteries. Two battery-powered lasers are set 15 cm apart for scale measurements. The red laser dots can usually be seen in the photo depending on the bottom type and the distance to the sea floor. A third battery powered laser is positioned at an angle so that when it intersects the other lasers, the Mini SEABOSS is at the optimum height off the bottom for a still photograph. The camera is set to a manual focus and set to a default focus distance once the camera is powered up. The default focus distance is slightly less than the optimum height above the seafloor to account for optical distortion under water. For more information on the SEABOSS system please see the cross references.</srccontr>

        <procdesc>The USGS Mini SEABOSS system was deployed to capture still photos and bottom imagery off the entrance to the Connecticut River in Long Island Sound as part of USGS RV Rafael cruises 2009-059-FA and 2010-010-FA.This system was used to obtain 2 to 5 still photographs at each station as the vessel drifted over the seabed for 2 to 5 minutes. Two lasers were set to provide scale; the third laser on the system was set to an angle such that the optimum photograph height was 50 cm. The default focus on the camera was set to 50 cm. The imaged area is most often within 0.4 to 0.7 meter from left to right. Other camera settings on the Mini SEABOSS are as follows: aperture is set at f/8; shutter speed is 1/250 second; digital Effects settings are Color +1, Contrast +1, and Filter +1 (Warming). The camera time is set to GMT. A total of 59 images of the sea floor were acquired. Although the images themselves have no georeferencing information, the time in the EXIF header of each image is related to the navigation available in an ESRI formatted shapefile: h12013_botphotos.shp. This data can be downloaded from the following locations:  http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2012/1103/data/botphotos/h12013_botphotos.zip; http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2012/1103/html/catalog.html.

        <procdesc>Edits to the metadata were made to fix any errors that MP v 2.9.32 flagged. This is necessary to enable the metadata to be successfully harvested for various data catalogs. In some cases, this meant adding text "Information unavailable" or "Information unavailable from original metadata" for those required fields that were left blank. Other minor edits were probably performed (title, publisher, publication place, etc.). The source information was incomplete and had to be modified to meet the standard. The metadata date (but not the metadata creator) was edited to reflect the date of these changes. The metadata available from a harvester may supersede metadata bundled within a download file. Compare the metadata dates to determine which metadata file is most recent.</procdesc>
