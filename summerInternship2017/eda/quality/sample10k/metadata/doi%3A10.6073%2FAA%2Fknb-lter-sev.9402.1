Research Hypotheses.
      
The purpose of this study is to determine whether or not the activities of small 
mammals regulate plant community structure, plant species diversity, and spatial 
vegetation patterns in Chihuahuan Desert shrublands and grasslands. What role if any 
do indigenous small mammal consumers have in maintaining desertified landscapes in 
the Chihuahuan Desert? Additionally, how do the effects of small mammals interact 
with changing climate to affect vegetation patterns over time? This study will provide 
long-term experimental tests of the roles of consumers on ecosystem pattern
and process across a latitudinal climate gradient. The following
questions or hypotheses will be addressed.
      
1) Do small mammals influence patterns of plant species composition and diversity, 
vegetation structure, and spatial patterns of vegetation canopy cover and biomass in 
Chihuahuan Desert shrublands and grasslands? Are small mammals keystone species 
that determine plant species composition and physiognomy of Chihuahuan Desert 
communities? Do small mammals have a significant role in maintaining the existence 
of shrub islands and spatial heterogeneity of creosotebush shrub communities?  
      
2) Do small mammals affect the taxonomic composition and spatial pattern of 
vegetation similarly or differently in grassland communities as compared to shrub 
communities? How do patterns compare between grassland and shrubland sites, and 
how do these relatively small scale patterns relate to overall landscape vegetation 
patterns?
      
3) Do small mammals interact with short-term (annual) and  long-term (decades) 
climate change to affect temporal changes in vegetation spatial patterns and species 
composition?
      
4) Do small mammals interact with other herbivore and granivore consumers enough to 
affect the species composition and abundance?s of other consumers such as ants and 
grasshoppers?</literalLayout></para></purpose><maintenance><description><section><para><literalLayout>SEVILLETA SMES CRYPTOGAMIC CRUST DATA 2002
\log 
03/13/06  - Checked data for missing data points, doubles, and errors.  
Missing data points were recorded using -999 (human Error), 
duplicates of data points were removed, and errors were 
corrected.  If a data point contained a measurement of zero
and a measurement with an observation, the zero observation
was removed.

- Date MM/DD/YY field was changed to just DATE. BLOCK field was 
changed to BLK.

- Changed dates to reflect that data was measured 
in 2002 and not in the 1970s.

- Changed to &quot;1&quot; in the EC field with comments.

- Any empty cells were filled in with -999 (human Error) for
missing data or an NA for not applicable.

- Yang Xia

03/17/06  - Changed data to fit parameters.  For example if a measurement was
6 it was rounded to the closest appropriate value, which in this case 
is 5. See &apos;Variable Descriptions&apos; Variable 7. Also, if a measurement 
was less than 0.5 it was rounded to 1 to indicate that an occurence
was present.

- For the Spring field season at the Creosote site, Plots missing are
BLK 1 Plot 1 Trt C and BLK 3 Plot 3 Trt C. These plots are added 
to the dataset as missing values.

- Metadata was modified to correct format.

 Salado creosotebush site. Each study site is 1 km by 0.5 km in area. Three rodent 
 trapping webs and four replicate experimental blocks of plots are randomly located at 
 each study site to measure vegetation responses to the exclusion of small mammals. 
 Each block of plots is 96 meters on each side. Each block of plots consists of 4 
 experimental study plots, each occupying 1/4 of each block. The blocks of study plots 
 are all oriented on a site in a X/Y coordinate system, with the top to the north. 
 Treatments within each block include one unfenced control plot (Treatment: C), one 
 plot fenced with hardware cloth and poultry wire to exclude rodents and rabbits 
 (Treatment: R), and one plot fenced only with poultry wire to exclude rabbits 
 (Treatment: L). The three treatments were randomly assigned to each of the four 
 possible plots in each block independently, and their arrangements differ from 
 block to block. Each of the three plots in a replicate block are separated by 20 meters. 
 
 Each experimental measurement plot measures 36 meters by 36 meters. A grid of 36 
 sampling points are positioned at 5.8-meter intervals on a systematically located 6 by 6 
 point grid within each plot. A permanent one-meter by one-meter vegetation 
 measurement quadrat is located at each of the 36 points. The 36 quadrats are numbered 
 1-36, starting with number 1 in the top left corner (north-west) of each plot (top being 
 north), and running left (west) to right (east), then down (south) one row, and then 
 right (east) to left (west), and so on Quadrat/rebar number one is in the northwest corner 
 of each plot, and numbers 1-6 are across the north side of the plot west to east, then 
 quadrat/rebar number 7 is just south of quadrat/rebar number 6, and rebar numbers 
 increase 7-12 east to west, and so on. 3-inch nails were originally placed in the top left 
 (north-west) corner of each quadrat. These may be difficult to see. A 3-meter wide 
 buffer area is situated between the grid of 36 points and the perimeter of each plot.
 
 While measuring vegetation on each quad, measure the total soil surface covered by 
 cryptobiotic crusts that  you see on each quadrat, to the nearest 5% of the one-meter 
 quadrat. State &quot;cryptogam cover (n)&quot; for the cover of cryptogam crusts on the soil surface 
 of the quadrat in terms of the 10 cm squares. For cover values less than 5, use increments 
 of 1.0. For cover values greater than 5, use increments of 5.0.  Cryptogams include lichens, 
 algae, and moss. Only measure cryptogam cover that is in the open, do not attempt to measure 
 within clumps of grass, etc. Some cryptogam cover has distinctive margins and is easy to 
 define and measure. However, many cryptogam crusts consist of many diffuse small patches 
 that are separated by bare soil, and distributed throughout the quadrat. For such diffuse 
 cover, determine the actual cover in one typical 10 by 10 cm square (e.g., 0.3), then count 
 the number of squares with diffuse cover (e.g., 5), and multiply the number of squares by 
 the actual cover for a typical square (e.g., 0.3 X 5 = 1.5, then round to 1.0 or 2.0, or if 
 the value had been greater than 5, round to the nearest increment of 5.0) for the total 
 cryptogam cover. All cryptogams are pooled into one observation, and no height is measured.</literalLayout></para></description></methodStep><sampling><studyExtent><description><para><literalLayout>Experimental Design: There are 2 study sites, the Five Points grassland site, and the Rio
