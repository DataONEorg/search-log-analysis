      <supplinf>Introduction --

This data set consists of digitized polygons of constant
hydraulic conductivity values for the Antlers aquifer in
southeastern Oklahoma. The Early Cretaceous-age Antlers
Sandstone is an important source of water in an area that
underlies about 4,400-square miles of all or part of Atoka,
Bryan, Carter, Choctaw, Johnston, Love, Marshall, McCurtain, and
Pushmataha Counties. The Antlers aquifer consists of sand, clay,
conglomerate, and limestone in the outcrop area. The upper part
of the Antlers aquifer consists of beds of sand, poorly cemented
sandstone, sandy shale, silt, and clay. The Antlers aquifer is
unconfined where it outcrops in about an 1,800-square-mile area
(Morton, 1992).

The hydraulic conductivity polygons were developed from the
hydraulic conductivity value used as input into a ground-water
flow model and from digital data of the surficial geology of the
Antlers Sandstone from Cederstrand (1996a, 1996b) except in
areas overlain by alluvial and terrace deposits near streams and
rivers. Morton (1992) interpolated the Antlers aquifer
boundaries under the alluvial and terrace deposits where streams
cross the aquifer outcrop. Aquifer boundary lines for areas
where the aquifer is overlain by alluvial and terrace deposits
were digitized and are similar to the aquifer boundaries shown
in Morton (1992). The Antlers aquifer in Texas (Morton, 1992) is
not included in this data set. The maps from which this data set
was derived were published at a scale of 1:250,000.

The constant hydraulic conductivity value used as input to the
ground-water flow model was estimated by Morton (1992) to be
5.74 feet per day. Digital Line Graph (DLG) format requires
numbers to be stored as integers. Therefore, the hydraulic
conductivity in feet per day was multiplied by 10, rounded to
the nearest whole number, and stored in the digital data sets as
tenths of a foot per day. For example 5.74 feet per day was
multiplied by 10, rounded to the nearest whole number, and
stored in the digital data sets as 57 tenths of a foot per day.

Ground-water flow models are numerical representations that
simplify and aggregate natural systems. Models are not unique;
different combinations of aquifer characteristics may produce
similar results. The hydraulic conductivity and recharge are
closely interrelated. As long as these two model inputs are in
balance the model has a small mean residual; it represents the
natural system numerically. If the hydraulic conductivity is
accurately known, the model can be used to accurately determine
recharge. Likewise, if the hydraulic conductivity is poorly
known, then the recharge will be poorly determined.

Therefore, values of hydraulic conductivity used in the model
and presented in this data set are not precise, but are within a
reasonable range when compared to independently collected data.
In most aquifers, hydraulic conductivity measurements made in
wells or in cores will range over several orders of magnitude,
even over short horizontal and vertical distances. Hydraulic
conductivity values derived from ground-water flow models
represent areal generalizations and do not reflect the large
local variance in well or core measurements.
Reviews Applied to Data --

This electronic report was subjected to the same review standard
that applies to all U.S. Geological Survey reports. Reviewers
were asked to check the topological consistency, tolerances,
attribute frequencies and statistics, projection, and geographic
extent. Reviewers were given digital data sets and paper plots
for checking against the source maps to verify the linework and
attributes. The reviewers checked the metadata and a_readme.1st
files for completeness and accuracy.

Related Spatial and Tabular Data Sets --

This data set is one of four digital map data sets being published
together for this aquifer. The four data sets are:

&gt;              aqbound -  aquifer boundaries

&gt;              cond    -  hydraulic conductivity

&gt;              recharg -  aquifer recharge

&gt;              wlelev  -  water-level elevation contours

Digital map data sets of the Oklahoma surficial geology digitized from
1:250,000-scale maps (or 1:125,000-scale maps for the three Oklahoma
panhandle counties) are published separately.

    <useconst>This data set was derived from scanned maps published at a scale
of 1:250,000 (Cederstrand, 1996a and 1996b), and represent the
hydraulic conductivity value reported in Morton (1992). Hydraulic
conductivity polygons represented at this scale are indicative
of broad, regional trends and should not be interpreted as site
specific.

Ground-water flow models are numerical representations that
simplify and aggregate natural systems. Models are not unique;
different combinations of aquifer characteristics may produce
similar results. The hydraulic conductivity and recharge are
closely interrelated. As long as these two model inputs are in
balance the model has a small mean residual; it represents the
natural system numerically. If the hydraulic conductivity is
accurately known, the model can be used to accurately determine
recharge. Likewise, if the hydraulic conductivity is poorly
known, then the recharge will be poorly determined.

Therefore, values of hydraulic conductivity used in the model
and presented in this data set are not precise, but are
within a reasonable range when compared to independently
collected data. In most aquifers, hydraulic conductivity
measurements made in wells or in cores will range over
several orders of magnitude, even over short horizontal and

from ground-water flow models represent areal generalizations

    <complete>This data set includes all the areas of specified hydraulic
conductivity published by Morton (1992) for the unconfined part of
the aquifer. The Antlers aquifer in Texas (Morton, 1992) is not
presented in this publication. This data set includes all the
aquifer boundaries for the unconfined part of the aquifer published
by Cederstrand (1996a, 1996b) except where the aquifer is covered
by alluvial and terrace deposits (Cederstrand, 1996b). Some
of the lines were interpolated where the Antlers aquifer is
overlain by alluvial and terrace deposits near streams and rivers
and are similar to the aquifer boundaries on maps in Morton
(1992). The polygons in this data set include the aquifer under
the alluvial and terrace deposits to represent the aquifer as
presented in Morton (1992). The Antlers aquifer in Texas (Morton,
1992) is not included in this data set.

Morton (1992) interpolated the aquifer boundaries under the

    <overview>
      <eaover>Each polygon in this data set has an associated attribute, K,
containing rounded values of hydraulic conductivity expressed in
tenths of a foot per day. For example, the hydraulic conductivity
value of 5.74 feet per day is rounded to 5.7 and stored as a K
value of 5.7 tenths of a foot per day. Polygons in this data set
that contain a K value of -99999 represent areas where the
hydraulic conductivity is not known. K is stored in the first
major code (MAJOR1) and 0 is stored in the first minor code
(MINOR1) for polygons in the Digital Line Graph (DLG) version
of this data set.

Each line in this digital data set has an associated attribute,
LSOURCE, that contains a code to indicate the source of the line.
An LSOURCE code of 2 indicates the line was extracted from
Cederstrand (1996a, 1996b), and an LSOURCE code of 4 indicates the
line is the authors' interpretation of the boundary where the
aquifer is overlain by alluvial or terrace deposits, similar to
Morton (1992). LSOURCE is stored in the first major code (MAJOR1)
and 0 is stored in the first minor code (MINOR1) for lines in
the Digital Line Graph (DLG) version of this data set.
