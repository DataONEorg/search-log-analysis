Pouyat, U.S. Forest Service   Introduction   The Baltimore Ecosystem Study (BES) has established a network of long-term permanent  biogeochemical study plots. These plots will provide long-term data on vegetation, soil and  hydrologic processes in the key ecosystem types within the urban ecosystem. The current network  of study plots includes eight forest plots, chosen to represent the range of forest conditions in the  area, and five grass plots. The network is being expanded to include more grass plots, agricultural  fields, urban yards and wetlands. These plots are complemented by a network of 200 less intensive  study plots located across the Baltimore metropolitan area. See Baltimore&apos;s Vegetation Structure  And Its Ability To Remove Air Pollutants And Sequester Carbon Dioxide.   Plots are currently instrumented with lysimeters (drainage and tension) to sample soil solution  chemistry, time domain reflectometry probes to measure soil moisture, dataloggers to measure soil  temperature and trace gas flux chambers to measure the flux of carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide and  methane from soil to the atmosphere. Measurements of in situ nitrogen mineralization, nitrification  and denitrification were made at approximately monthly intervals from Fall 1998 - Fall 2000.  Detailed vegetation characterization (all layers) was done in summer 1998 [link to vegetation data].   Plot Locations and Characterizations   In November of 1998 four rural, forested plots were established at Oregon Ridge Park in Baltimore  County northeast of the Gwynns Falls Watershed. Oregon Ridge Park contains Pond Branch, the  forested reference watershed for BES. Two of these four plots are located on the top of a slope; the  other two are located midway up the slope.   Four urban, forested plots were established in November 1998, two at Leakin Park and two  adjacent to Hillsdale Park in west Baltimore City in the Gwynns Falls.   In May 1999 two grass, lawn plots were established at McDonogh School in Baltimore County  west of the city in the Gwynns Falls. One of these plots is an extremely low intensity management  area (mowed once or twice a year) and one is in a low intensity management area (frequent  mowing, no fertilizer or herbicide use).   Three grass lawn plots were established on the campus of the University of Maryland, Baltimore  County (UMBC) in fall 2000. Two of these plots are in medium intensity management areas  (frequent mowing, moderate applications of fertilizer and herbicides) and one is in a high intensity  management area (frequent mowing, high applications of fertilizer and herbicides). Soil moisture is measured once every four to six weeks at each plot. In each of the forested plots,  five (six at Leakin plot #2) time domain reflectometry waveguide probes from SoilMoisture  Equipment Corporation were installed vertically into the soil at random locations throughout the plot.  The waveguide probes are 20 cm long, so those vertically installed span a depth of 0 to 20 cm  below ground. Each forested plot also has one (two at Leakin plot #2) set of four waveguide probes  installed horizontally into the soil in one location at four depths: 10, 20, 30, and 50 cm below  ground. The McDonogh plots each have two sets of horizontal and no vertical waveguide probes.   Attached to each belowground waveguide is an aboveground cable with a BNC Male Coaxial Fitting  on the end. This fitting connects with SoilMoisture&apos;s Trase System I (Model 6050X1, Version 2000  Software), which uses time domain reflectometry (TDR) to measure soil moisture. Every four to six  weeks each individual vertical and horizontal waveguide in each plot is connected to the portable  Trase TDR processor; soil moisture is measured instantaneously and stored in the processor. After  all plots are completed, the stored data is downloaded onto a PC at the BES office.</paragraph></abstract><keywordSet><keyword>soil, moisture, baltimore, urban, tdr</keyword><keywordThesaurus></keywordThesaurus></keywordSet><additionalInfo><paragraph></paragraph></additionalInfo><rights><paragraph>No constraints.
