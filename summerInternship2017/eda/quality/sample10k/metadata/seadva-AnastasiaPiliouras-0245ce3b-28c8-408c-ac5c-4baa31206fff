      <abstract>This collection contains time-lapse photographs from experiments conducted by A. Piliouras and W. Kim, the results of which are published in Piliouras et al., (2014) in Lithosphere: http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/L323.1. More detailed methodologies can be found in the manuscript.

Seismic data from the Gulf of Mexico showed evidence of large lenticular sand bodies (linear dunes) partially subsided into the underlying Louann salt. The dunes were preserved after a marine transgression, and they had variable preserved topographies. We performed experiments to determine what controlled dune subsidence rates and the amount of subsidence, such that we might produce variable subsided dune topographies. The dune here is intended to be a cross section through a linear dune, so it is essentially a triangular pile of sand (silica) deposited relatively instantaneously on top of PDMS (polydimethylsiloxane), which we use as a proxy for salt (see references within Piliouras et al., (2014)). Run 1 has a sand to salt thickness ratio of 1 (sand thickness = salt thickness = 14.5 cm), while Run 2 has a ratio of 0.5 (sand thickness = 7.5 cm, salt thickness = 14.5 cm). Here we supply the original time lapse images and corresponding movies, as well as images corrected for camera lens distortion. Run 1 time lapse photos were every 5 minutes, and Run 2 time lapse photos were every 3 minutes. The lens corrected photos have 1 pixel = 1 mm. Flume dimensions can be found in the manuscript listed above to resize and/or process the raw photos.</abstract>
