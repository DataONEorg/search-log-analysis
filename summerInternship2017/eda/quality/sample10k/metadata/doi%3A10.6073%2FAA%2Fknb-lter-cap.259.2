                linkages, the extent to which surface and groundwater exchanges, and the rate of
                instream biotic processes. The importance of these variables may fluctuate as a
                function of climate regime, catchment geomorphology, or level of human impact. A
                mechanistic understanding of the influence of each of these variables on ecosystem
                functioning will increase understanding of the role of streams in global nutrient
                and carbon cycles. Of particular interest is dissolved organic carbon (DOC), an
                important source of carbon and energy for microbial processes. Respiration by
                heterotrophic bacterial communities has recently been linked to the quality (ability
                of microbes to utilize C source) of the DOC pool in streams. DOC not only influences
                stream nutrient supply, but also the transport of contaminants and the attenuation
                of UV radiation. This dissertation focused on DOC delivery to two arid-land stream
                ecosystems, one native desert (Sycamore Creek, AZ), and one urban (Phoenix, AZ). The
                overall objectives of this work were to (1) document patterns in DOC quantity and
                chemical composition in response to flooding and groundwater exchange, (2) generate
                and test hypotheses explaining variation in DOC quantity and quality and (3) relate
                this variation to microbial activity. In the native desert stream ecosystem, the
                climate regime influenced seasonal variation in the quantity and quality of DOC
                inputs, with higher complexity and higher concentrations of DOC in summer monsoonal
                runoff. In contrast, human alteration of geomorphology and hydrologic flowpaths in
                the Phoenix metropolitan area significantly influenced streamwater chemistry in
                comparison to low-impact streams in the Sonoran Desert. In the city, mechanisms of
                nutrient retention and transformation were often shifted from dominance by biotic to
                abiotic ones, severely dampening the influence of climate regime and substituting
                instead the maintenance of food production and waste management as the dominant
                large-scale controlling factors. Patterns of microbial respiration and extracellular
                enzyme production indicate that the communitys ability to react to changes in DOM
                composition may create shifts in extracellular enzyme production while maintaining
                relatively consistent levels of community respiration.</para></abstract><keywordSet><keyword keywordType="place">GILA RIVER</keyword><keyword keywordType="theme">STREAM</keyword><keyword keywordType="theme">Inorganic Nutrients</keyword><keyword keywordType="place">SONORAN DESERT</keyword><keyword keywordType="place">PHOENIX</keyword><keyword keywordType="theme">water chemistry</keyword><keyword keywordType="theme">desert</keyword><keyword keywordType="theme">urban</keyword><keyword keywordType="theme">canal</keyword><keyword keywordType="theme">caplter created</keyword><keyword keywordType="theme">caplter</keyword><keyword keywordType="theme">Central Arizona Phoenix Longterm Ecological

                            three times (March, June, Oct) in 2000, approximately every 6 weeks
                            during 2001, and immediately following two winter floods in 2001.
                            Samples for total inorganic carbon and pH were collected in the field
                            with no headspace and transported to the laboratory for analysis.
                            Conductivity and water temperature were measured at each site using an
                            Orion field meter. A depth-integrated, channel-wide sample was collected
                            at each site into a 3- L nalgene bottle, transported to the laboratory
                            on ice, and then split into 10 subsamples. Three subsamples were
                            filtered through a Whatman GF/F ashed filter, and the filtrate was used
                            for DOC analysis using high-temperature combustion on a Shimadzu
                            TOC-5000 carbon analyzer. Materials remaining on the GF/F filter were
                            used for ash-free dry mass determination and elemental analysis using a
                            Perkin-Elmer 2400 Series II CHNS/O analyzer. Three other subsamples were
                            filtered through a membrane filter of porosity 0.45 µm, followed by
                            cation (Ca, Mg, Na, K) analysis using a Varian SpectrAA 400 Flame atomic
                            absorption spectrometer, dissolved nutrient analyses using colorimetric
                            116 methods on a LACHAT Quick Chem 8000 flow-injection autoanalyzer,
                            and sulfate analysis using a Dionex 4000i ion chromatograph. The
                            remaining subsamples were filtered through a Whatman GF/F filter and a
                            known volume of filtrate was placed in a pre-weighed glass beaker, dried
                            at 100°C, and reweighed. The difference in mass between beakers before
                            water addition and after evaporation was used to calculate total

                            to the mainstem, we collected samples of five types. The first type was
                            atmospheric deposition, for which we employed two methods of collection.
                            One method, used at all three rain collection sites, comprised a funnel
                            connected to a nalgene bottle by plastic tubing. This generated a bulk
                            deposition sample, defined here as wet deposition plus any dryfall
                            accumulation within one week of the storm. Water used to rinse the
                            funnels after a 1-3 week period of no rain was analyzed as a dry
                            deposition sample. Atmospheric deposition was also collected at site 3
                            using National Atmospheric Deposition Program (NADP) standard methods
                            (http://nadp.sws.uiuc.edu/). The second sample type, sheetflow, was
                            collected using 3.7-L plastic jugs connected to v-shaped aluminum
                            flashing installed level with the ground surface at site 1. This design
                            integrated the entire area upslope of the flashing, while at sites 2 and
                            3 sheetflow collectors were tear-shaped and collected water from only
                            inside the flashing. The third type of samples along the upland-stream
                            gradient was rill samples collected using buried bottles with a
                            mesh-covered opening secured directly above the rill sediments at site
                            1. The fourth type of gradient sample, from the largest tributaries, was
                            collected as a grab sample as soon as possible after flooding began. And
                            finally, for the mainstem of Sycamore Creek, a batterypowered
                            autosampler was programmed to start sampling surface water once a
                            co-axial cable positioned directly above the waters surface came in
                            contact with the rising floodwaters</para></section></description></methodStep><methodStep><description><section><title>measures of DOC chemical complexity (SUVA and fluorometric
