This part of DS 781 presents data for the bathymetry and shaded-relief maps of Offshore Pacifica, California.  The raster data file is included in "BathymetryHS_OffshorePacifica.zip," which is accessible from http://pubs.usgs.gov/ds/781/OffshorePacifica/data_catalog_OffshorePacifica.html.

The bathymetry and shaded-relief maps of Offshore Pacifica, California, were generated from bathymetry data collected by Fugro Pelagos, and by California State University, Monterey Bay (CSUMB). Mapping was completed between 2005 and 2007, using a combination of 400-kHz Reson 7125 and 244-kHz Reson 8101 multibeam echosounders. These mapping missions combined to collect bathymetry from about the 10-m isobath to beyond the 3-nautical-mile limit of California’s State Waters.

      <purpose>These data are intended for science researchers, students, policy makers, and the general public. These data can be used with geographic information systems or other software to identify bathymetric features. These data are not intended to be used for navigation.</purpose>

        <procdesc>During the mapping missions, an Applanix position and motion compensation system (POS/MV) was used to accurately position the vessel during data collection, and it also accounted for vessel motion such as heave, pitch, and roll (position accuracy, ±2 m; pitch, roll, and heading accuracy, ±0.02¡; heave accuracy, ±5%, or 5 cm). KGPS altitude data (Fugro Pelagos, StarFix HP &amp; XP units; CSUMB, NavCom 2050) were used to account for tide cycle fluctuations and sound velocity profiles were collected with an Applied Microsystems SVPlus sound velocimeter. Soundings were corrected for vessel motion using the Applanix POS/MV data, for variations in water-column sound velocity using the AM SVPlus data, and for variations in water height (tides) using vertical-position data from the KGPS receivers. Final XYZ soundings and bathymetric-surface models were referenced to the World Geodetic System of 1984 (WGS 1984) relative to the North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD 1988).</procdesc>

        <procdesc>California Seafloor Mapping Project 2-m resolution bathymetry data (CSMP survey blocks CC-01, CC-02, CC-03, CC-05, and Entrance to San Francisco Bay) within this map were downloaded from California State University, Monterey Bay, Seafloor Mapping Lab (http://seafloor.csumb.edu/SFMLwebDATA.htm). Merge all bathymetry data into 2-m-resolution bathymetry grid and clip to the Offshore Pacifica, California, map boundary. To create the shaded-relief imagery, an illumination having an azimuth of 300 degrees and 45 degrees above the horizon was applied to the bathymetry grid. The bathymetry grid only was projected horizontally from WGS 1984 relative to NAVD 1988 to the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD 1983) relative to NAVD 1988 using ESRI ArcGIS raster projection tool “WGS_84_(ITRF00)_To_NAD_1983”.</procdesc>

The complete Offshore of Pacifica bathymetry data were originally archived as an ESRI grid with the following attributes. NOTE: the horizontal datum of the bathymtry data (NAD83) differs from the horizontal datum of other layers in this DS (WGS84). Some bathymetry grids within this map were projected horizontally from WGS84 to NAD83 using ESRI tools to be more consistent with the vertical reference of the North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD88).
