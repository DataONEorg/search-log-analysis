Allozyme polymorphisms of 6 enzyme systems, including 9 loci and 12 alleles, were used to estimate the genetic diversity of A. spinulosa from 9 sites throughout Taiwan. The mean number of allele per locus (A) was 1.34, the percentage of polymorphic loci (P) was 34.5%, the observed heterozygosity (Ho) was 0.145, and the expected heterozygosity (He) was 0.141. The genetic diversity of A. spinulosa in Taiwan was higher than mean values of other diploid ferns and tree ferns. The large population size and an intergametophytic outcrossing mating system were thought to be important factors in A. spinulosa maintaining a higher level of genetic diversity. Inbreeding has also sometimes occurred, and this might have assisted the successful colonization by
a single long-distance dispersal spore. At the population level, the Nanjenshan population (NJ), located in southern Taiwan, showed the highest expected heterozygosity (He). Additionally, lower levels of genetic differentiation among populations were detected and are thought to be a result of high gene flow due to spores.</para></abstract><keywordSet><keyword>allozyme variations</keyword><keyword>Alsophila spinulosa</keyword><keyword>Cyatheaeae</keyword><keyword>Taiwan</keyword></keywordSet><intellectualRights><para>無使用權限制</para></intellectualRights><coverage scope="document"><geographicCoverage scope="document"><geographicDescription>A. spinulosa from 9 natural populations in Taiwan; Chihnan (CN), Dasyueshan (DS), Fushan (FS), Hueisun (HS), Nanjenshan (NJ), Taimali (TM), Tengjhih (TJ), Yangmingshan (YM), and Zengwun (ZW)</geographicDescription><boundingCoordinates><westBoundingCoordinate>119.5</westBoundingCoordinate><eastBoundingCoordinate>122.25</eastBoundingCoordinate><northBoundingCoordinate>25.75</northBoundingCoordinate><southBoundingCoordinate>21.125</southBoundingCoordinate></boundingCoordinates></geographicCoverage><temporalCoverage scope="document"><rangeOfDates><beginDate><calendarDate>2003-01-01</calendarDate></beginDate><endDate><calendarDate>2006-12-31</calendarDate></endDate></rangeOfDates></temporalCoverage><taxonomicCoverage scope="document"><taxonomicClassification><taxonRankName>Genus</taxonRankName><taxonRankValue>Alsophila</taxonRankValue><taxonomicClassification><taxonRankName>Species</taxonRankName><taxonRankValue>spinulosa</taxonRankValue></taxonomicClassification></taxonomicClassification></taxonomicCoverage></coverage><contact scope="document"><references>1260256634812</references></contact><methods><methodStep><description><section><title>Sampling</title><para>In this study, we collected samples of A. spinulosa from 9 natural populations in Taiwan; Chihnan (CN), Dasyueshan (DS), Fushan (FS), Hueisun (HS), Nanjenshan (NJ), Taimali (TM), Tengjhih (TJ), Yangmingshan (YM), and Zengwun (ZW).

The extracted enzymes were absorbed onto Whatman 3MM filters (4×12 mm), stored at -80℃ until needed for analysis. Allozyme variation was studied by means of horizontal starch gel electrophoresis using 12% starch gels. The following 6 enzyme systems were examined:EST (esterase, E.C.3.1.1.1), IDH (isocitrate dehydrogenase, E.C.1.1.1.42.), MDH (malate dehydrogenase, E.C.1.1.1.37.), MR (meandione reductase, E.C.1.6.5.2.), 6PGD (6-phosophogluconate</para><para>dehydrogenase, E.C.1.1.1.44.), and SkDH (shikimic acid dehydrogenase, E.C.1.1.1.25.).

The following estimated genetic parameters were used to quantify the level of genetic diversity within populations</para><para>using the BIOSYS-1 program (Swofford and Selander 1981): the mean number of alleles per locus (A), the effective number of alleles per locus (Ae) (Crow and Kimura 1970), the proportion of polymorphic loci (P), the average</para><para>observed heterozygosity (Ho), and the average expected heterozygosity or genetic diversity (He = 1 - Σp2</para><para>i, where pi is the frequency of the ith allele at a locus) (Nei 1975). Wright’s (1969) F-statistics (FIS, FIT,and FST) were used to quantify the degree of differentiation among populations and to describe the genetic structure of this species.</para><para>Values of FIS and FIT indicate the level of deviations from Hardy-Weinberg (H-W) expectations at the population and species levels, respectively. An FIS value equal to or nearly zero indicates that the mating system is random; on the other hand, a significant negative value indicates an excess of heterozygotes, while a significant positive value indicates an excess of homozygotes. The Chi-squared test was used to evaluate whether FIS and FIT values for each locus significantly differed from 0 (Li and Horvitz 1953). Values of FST indicate genetic variations among populations</para><para>or the levels of genetic differentiation among populations. Fixation indices (F), reflecting deviations from H-W equilibrium of each population, were calculated by the formula F = (1 - Ho / He), and the outcrossing rate (t) was estimated using t = (1 - F) / (1 + F) (Weir 1990). We also estimated the level of gene flow among populations using Wright’s (1951)</para><para>formula, Nm = (1 - FST) / 4FST. Nei’s (1978) unbiased genetic identity (I) and genetic distance (D) were calculated</para><para>for all pairs of populations. A cluster analysis based on Nei’s genetic distance (Nei 1978) via the unweighted pairwise group method (UPGMA) was used to present relationships among populations. A Mantel test (Mantel 1967) with 1000 random permutations was performed between the matrix of genetic differentiation and geographic distance to test</para><para>whether isolation by distance was significant. Pairwise genetic differentiation between populations was expressed as FST / (1 - FST) (Rousset 1997).</para></section></description></methodStep></methods><access authSystem="knb" order="denyFirst" scope="document"><allow><principal>public</principal><permission>read</permission></allow></access></dataset></eml:eml>
