The geodetic coordinates (Lat., Lon.) and elevation of each sampling location were determined using a Global Positioning System (GPS Pathfinder Basic Receivers, Trimble Navigation Ltd.) in the field.

It has a warm                                 and wet climate and includes a variety of tropical habitats and                                 forest types and streams, and a high diversity of plants and                                 animals. A key feature of these ecosystems is disturbance.                                 Hurricanes, landslides, and human disturbance have shaped the                                 forest, and research by LUQ has stimulated a new appreciation of the                                 significance of large-scale disturbances in tropical forested                                 ecosystems and the key role of plants and animals in shaping the                                 response to these events. Hurricanes occurring one and 10 years                                 after LUQ began in 1988 provided landscape-scale natural experiments                                 which are still followed closely.</geographicDescription><boundingCoordinates><westBoundingCoordinate>-65.92</westBoundingCoordinate><eastBoundingCoordinate>-65.7</eastBoundingCoordinate><northBoundingCoordinate>18.35</northBoundingCoordinate><southBoundingCoordinate>18.23</southBoundingCoordinate><boundingAltitudes><altitudeMinimum>20</altitudeMinimum><altitudeMaximum>1060</altitudeMaximum><altitudeUnits>meter</altitudeUnits></boundingAltitudes></boundingCoordinates></geographicCoverage></coverage><contact scope="document"><individualName><givenName>Charles A.S.</givenName><surName>Hall</surName></individualName><organizationName>State University of New York (SUNY)</organizationName><positionName>Principal Investigator</positionName><address scope="document"><deliveryPoint>College of Environmental Science and Forestry</deliveryPoint><deliveryPoint>301 Illick Hall</deliveryPoint><deliveryPoint>1 Forestry Drive</deliveryPoint><city>Syracuse</city><administrativeArea>NY</administrativeArea><postalCode>13210</postalCode><country>USA</country></address><phone phonetype="voice">(315)470-6870</phone><phone phonetype="fax">(315)470-6934</phone><electronicMailAddress>chall@esf.edu</electronicMailAddress></contact><publisher scope="document"><organizationName>Luquillo Experimental Forest LTER</organizationName><address scope="document"><deliveryPoint>University of Puerto Rico, Rio Piedras</deliveryPoint><deliveryPoint>P.

While we collected the majority of samples near the trails, we also took some samples far away from the trails for the purpose of considering the geomorphic and topographic features. The sampling intervals were smaller in transects where we could see that the vegetation and soil types and topography varied rapidly, and larger in areas of relatively uniform vegetation, soil and topographic features. At each site, within a radius of approximate 30-m, we removed the leaf litter from the forest floor and took 5 subsamples of 0 to 30-cm depth of mineral soil with a 1.85-cm diameter soil corer. Then the subsamples were mixed together in plastic bags as the representative soil sample for that site. We sealed the bags to retain moisture.</literalLayout></para></description></methodStep></methods><project scope="document"><title>Soil Carbon and Nutrients in the Luquillo Experimental Forest (LEF)</title><personnel scope="document"><individualName><givenName>Charles A.S.</givenName><surName>Hall</surName></individualName><role>principalInvestigator</role></personnel><abstract><para><literalLayout>In this study, we examine the spatial variability of soil carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus in the Luquillo Experimental Forest (LEF) using a spatially explicit version of the CENTURY biogeochemistry model.
