            <abstract>The U.S. Geological Survey's Upper Midwest Environmental Sciences Center (UMESC) collects aerial photography of the Upper Mississippi River System (UMRS) floodplain on a regular basis. These data are used to support the Center's long-term goals of understanding the UMRS and developing useful products for the Long Term Resource Monitoring Program (LTRMP). In 2000, 1:16,000-scale true color aerial photos were collected on the Mississippi River from Cairo, IL to Minneapolis, MN and the on Illinois River from its confluence with the Mississippi near Grafton, IL to Lake Michigan/Chicago, IL. The photos were collected using a 60% stereo overlap between photos in the same flight line and a 30% overlap between flight lines. At the time this document was prepared, UMESC was in the process of scanning, georeferencing and compiled approximately every other photo into georeferenced mosaics for the navigation pools. These mosaics are served as compressed .sid images, so they'll be easier to download vial the Internet. Note: While the photos have been georeferenced, they have not been orthorectified.</abstract>
            <purpose>The Upper Midwest Environmental Sciences Center administers the Long Term Resource Monitoring Program (LTRMP), authorized under the Water Resources Development Act of 1986 (Public Law 99-662). The mission of the LTRMP is to provide decision makers with information to maintain the Upper Mississippi River System (UMRS) as a viable large river ecosystem given its multiple-use character. The long-term goals of the Program are to understand the system, determine resource trends and impacts, develop management alternatives, manage information, and develop useful products. The collection and distribution of high-resolution aerial photography aids the Center in meeting these goals.</purpose>
            <supplinf>In 1989, UMESC and the LTRMP began collecting aerial photos of the Upper Mississippi River System from Cairo, IL to Minneapolis, MN and the Illinois River from its confluence with the Mississippi near Grafton, IL upstream to Joliet, IL. In years past the extent was road/railroad to road/railroad. In 2000, the area photographed was expanded to bottom of the bluff to the bottom of the bluff.</supplinf>

To provide photo interpreters with stereo coverage, the photos were collected using a 60% overlap between photos within the same flight line and 30% overlap between adjacent flight lines. To reduce the number of photos that needed to be scanned, all photos were laid out geographically on a table so the photo overlaps could be reviewed. Approximately every other photo was pulled from the collection and set aside.</procdesc>
