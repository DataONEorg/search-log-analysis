      <abstract>Water quality in the Barnegat Bay-Little Egg Harbor estuary along the New Jersey coast is the focus of a multidisciplinary research project begun in 2011 by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) in partnership with the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection. This narrow estuary is the drainage for the Barnegat Watershed and flushed by just three inlets connecting it to the Atlantic Ocean, is experiencing degraded water quality, algal blooms, loss of seagrass, and increases in oxygen -depletion events, seaweed, stinging nettles, and brown tide. The scale of the estuary and the scope of the problems within it necessitate a multidisciplinary approach that includes characterizing its physical characteristics (for example, depth, magnitude and direction of tidal currents, distribution of seafloor and subseafloor sediment) and modeling how the physical characteristics interact to affect the estuary's water quality. Scientists from USGS Coastal and Marine Geology Program offices in Woods Hole, Massachusetts, and St. Petersburg, Florida, began mapping the seafloor of the Barnegat Bay-Little Egg Harbor estuary in November 2011 and completed in September 2013. With funding from the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection and logistical support from the USGS New Jersey Water Science Center, they collected data with a suite of geophysical tools, including swath bathymetric sonar for measuring seafloor depth, a sidescan sonar for collecting acoustic-backscatter data (which provides information about seafloor texture and sediment type), subbottom profiler for imaging sediment layers beneath the floor of the estuary, and sediment samples with bottom photographs for ground validation of the acoustic data. 2011-041-FA: http://woodshole.er.usgs.gov/operations/ia/public_ds_info.php?fa=2011-041-FA 2012-003-FA: http://woodshole.er.usgs.gov/operations/ia/public_ds_info.php?fa=2012-003-FA 2013-014-FA: http://woodshole.er.usgs.gov/operations/ia/public_ds_info.php?fa=2013-014-FA 2013-030-FA: http://woodshole.er.usgs.gov/operations/ia/public_ds_info.php?fa=2013-030-FA</abstract>
      <purpose>The purpose of this bathymetric grid is to serve as internal quality control by crossing the main survey lines at or near 90 degree angle to check for constancy in tides and to "tie" all the lines together. Most of the survey lines in this grid were not used in the bbbath2m grid published in this report, but can be used in conjunction with the seismic profiles collected during the same line.</purpose>

        <horizpar>Two different navigation systems (DGPS and RTK) were used to record horizontal positions of the bathymetric sonar.
2011-041-FA and 2013-014-FA: Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS) navigation was used to determine the horizontal position (x, and y coordinates) of the GPS antenna mounted above the SWATHplus-H transducers with sub-meter accuracy. A motion reference unit (Coda Octopus F180) was mounted directly above the sonar transducers and continuously measured vertical displacement (heave) and attitude (pitch and roll) of the vessel during data acquisition. Horizontal offsets between navigation and attitude antennas and the SWATHplus-H transducers were recorded and applied during acquisition in the configuration files for the Swath Processer and Coda Octopus software. Differential corrections were obtained real-time via the Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) providing horizontal accuracy of 1-2 meters.
2012-003-FA and 2013-030-FA Real Time Kinematic (RTK) navigation was used to determine the horizontal position (x, and y coordinates) of the GPS antenna mounted above the SWATHplus-H transducers with sub-meter accuracy. A RTK-enabled motion reference unit (Coda Octopus F190) was mounted directly above the sonar transducers and continuously measured vertical displacement (heave) and attitude (pitch and roll) of the vessel during data acquisition. Horizontal offsets between navigation and attitude antennas and the SWATHplus-H transducers were applied during acquisition in the configuration files for the Swath Processor and Coda Octopus software.</horizpar>

        <vertaccr>A motion reference unit was mounted directly above the sonar transducers and continuously measured vertical displacement (heave) and attitude (pitch and roll) of the vessel during data acquisition. A Coda Octopus F180 motion reference unit was used for survey 2011-041-FA and 2013-014-FA. During surveys 2012-003-FA and 2013-030-FA a Coda Octopus F190 was used. Vertical offsets between navigation and attitude antennas and the SWATHplus-H transducers were applied during acquisition in the configuration files for the Swath Processor and Coda Octopus software. Vertical accuracy of the raw data may approximate 1 percent of water depth, based on SWATHplus interferometric sonar system specifications, which translates to 0.1 to 0.23 meters within the Barnegat Bay survey area. Real Time Kinematic (RTK)-GPS was used to continuously measure changes in sea-surface elevations relative to the North American Vertical Datum (NAVD 88) with decimeter-scale accuracies. Tide-correction was applied during post-processing (see process steps). Refraction artifacts were minimized by sound velocity profiles throughout the survey area to model the spatial and temporal variability of sound velocity structure of the water column. Changes in vessel draft due to fuel and water usage were not considered.</vertaccr>

        <srccontr>SONAR CONFIGURATION: Bathymetry data were acquired using a Systems Engineering and Assessment Ltd (SEA) SWATHplus-H interferometric sonar operating at a frequency of 468 kHz. The sonar transducers were mounted on a rigid pole installed on the bow of the R/V Rafael and was deployed at a depth of 0.7 m below the water line while collecting data. Typical sonar operating parameters include a transmit power of 60%, a transmit length of 34 or 43 cycles, and a sample rate of 4096 samples per channel.
SPEED OF SOUND; sound velocity profiles were collected approximately every two hours, or when water properties changed using a hand-deployed sampler. Sound velocity data within the water column was measured using AML Oceanographic SVP Plus profiler during surveys 2011-041-FA and 2012-003-FA, and an AML Oceanographic MINOS-X profiler during 2013-014 and 2013-030.
TIDES: Soundings were referenced to the North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD 88) using 1-minute averaged RTK-GPS sea-surface elevation data.</srccontr>

        <procdesc>Step 1:Process GPS Tides Data for all three surveys:
Depths were corrected to North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD88)) using the 1 second RTK-GPS heights from the GPS receiver mounted over the SWATHplus-H sonar head. Two scripts were used to extract the navigation and described below:
Script "getNovatelTides": extracts the "TID" record from each Hypack line file "parseHypackNovatelTides.awk": calculates the average TID value for every two minutes. Each day was appended to a master tide file in CARIS format ("SurveyName"Master.tid) and merged into the line files in Processing Step #3 below.</procdesc>

Each processed file (*.sxp) was imported to the new HIPS project using the import/conversion wizard. The line files for each day were merged with the Mastertide file (SurveyNameMasterTide.tid) to reference each line to NAVD 88. A 2-meter Bathymetric and Statistical Error (BASE) surface was created from the tie line files for each day. The BASE surface for each day was reviewed for an inconsistencies or data anomalies. Navigation was edited as needed using the navigation editor tool in HIPS. Filters were applied to each line including beam-to-beam slopes (1 degree) and an across track distance of 3-4 times water depth. For a nadir depth of 3 meters an across track filter of 3 times water depth would reduce the swath coverage to 9 meters on each side for a total swath coverage of 18 meters.</procdesc>

Output surfaces: 2011_041_2m_tl.csar, 2012_003_2m_tl.csar, 2013_014_2m_tl.csar, 2013_030_2m_tl.csar where the "tl" defines these surfaces as using the tielines only. Surfaces were combined in CARIS Base Editor (v. 4.0) using the "combine" tool and "Data Start Date is least" rule for overlapping cells. This rule condition means that earlier surveys have importance over later surveys where they may overlap. Final output surface= BarnBayOFR2m.csar. This surface was then converted to an ascii raster (bbtl2m.asc) using the "export surface to Esri ASCII Raster" tool within Base Editor (v. 4.0). Ascii file was then imported to ArcGIS (v. 9.3.1) using the "ASCII to Raster" tool within the Conversion toolbox to produce the final 32-bit floating point grid (bbtl2m).</procdesc>
