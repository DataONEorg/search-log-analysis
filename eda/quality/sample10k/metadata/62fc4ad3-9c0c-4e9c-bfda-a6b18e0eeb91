    <descript>
      <abstract>Historical shoreline surveys were conducted by the National Ocean Service (NOS), dating back to the early 1800s. The maps resulting from these surveys, often called t-sheets, provide a reference of historical shoreline position that can be compared to modern data to identify shoreline change. The t-sheets are stored at the National Archives and many have been scanned by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and are available on the NOAA Shoreline Web site (http://www.shoreline.noaa.gov/data/datasheets/t-sheets.html). While some scanned t-sheets were georeferenced and digitized by NOAA, still others remain as non-georeferenced raster files (http://nosimagery.noaa.gov/images/shoreline_surveys/survey_scans/NOAA_Shoreline_Survey_Scans.html).
New_Jersey_1839_75_t-sheets.zip features 8 georeferenced raster t-sheets for the New Jersey coastline from 1839 to 1875. The data were scanned by NOAA, but were not georeferenced. The t-sheets included in this data release are: T-121 (1839), T-119 Part 1 (1841), T-1084 (1868), T-1166 (1870), T-1333 (1871), T-1315a (1872), T-1371 (1874), T-1407 (1875). Digital files were georeferenced, corrected to a modern datum, and shorelines digitized to provide a vector polyline depicting the historical shoreline position using ArcGIS 10.3.1. GEoreferenced t-sheets were used to delineate and shorelines for use in long-term shoreline and wetland analyses for Hurricane Sandy wetland physical change assessment.</abstract>
      <purpose>Shoreline data are considered a crucial element in performing change analysis for erosion and accretion studies and for tracking shoreline movement over time. T-sheets were downloaded, georeferenced and digitized to document the short and long-term changes of select study areas along the New Jersey coastline. Digitized shorelines from the t-sheets provide an accurate and measurable change in shape, area, and shoreline movement over short- and long- term periods.</purpose>
      <supplinf>These data represent the shoreline position when the topographic sheets were created and do not necessarily represent present conditions.</supplinf>

    <logic>Georeferenced t-sheets were checked to ensure they were in the correct location, using t-sheet shorelines from 1915. If necessary, some t-sheets were shifted from the United States Standard Datum of 1915 to the North American Datum of 1927 (NAD27). See processing steps for more details. The t-sheets were also checked to ensure the shorelines matched up from one t-sheet to the next, with the exception of T-119 part 1 and T-121. T-119 part 1 and T-121 represent earlier dates (1839 and 1841) than surrounding t-sheets (1866-75)so they do not correctly match up and were left "as is". As a final quality control, reference points were checked to ensure they overlapped from one t-sheet to the next and were adjusted accordingly, if necessary.</logic>

      <procstep>
        <procdesc>T-sheet maps created for the New Jersey coastline from 1839 to 1875 were downloaded from the NOAA shoreline website as non-georeferenced t-sheets. Downloaded t-sheets include: T-121 (1839), T-119 Part 1 (1841), T-1084 (1868), T-1166 (1870), T-1333 (1871), T-1315a (1872), T-1371 (1874), T-1407 (1875). Since T-1315b was not available T-119 Part 1 and T-121 were used to fill in the missing area. The t-sheets were projected into "NAD_1983_StatePlane_New_Jersey_FIPS_2900_Feet" as determined by using metadata provided with georeferenced 1915 New Jersey t-sheets that were previously completed by NOAA. The t-sheets were then reprojected into the North American Datum of 1927 for georeferencing, see the "Notes" field in the attribute table for more information.</procdesc>
        <procdate>20160609</procdate>
      </procstep>
      <procstep>
        <procdesc>T-121, T-1166, and T-1407 were georeferenced using NAD27 graticules and no shift was necessary. To do this, the t-sheets in the NAD27 projection were added to ArcMap 10.3.1 and the "Georeferencing" toolbar was opened. After locating a NAD27 graticule on the t-sheet a mark was placed and the coordinates in degrees, minutes, seconds (DMS) format were entered. The t-sheet was then auto-corrected to that coordinate. This process was repeated for all remaining NAD27 graticules on each t-sheet.</procdesc>
        <procdate>20160610</procdate>
      </procstep>
      <procstep>
        <procdesc>T-119 Part 1, T-1084, T-1315a, T-1333, and T-1371 were georeferenced using the U.S. Standard Datum of 1915 graticules and shifted to NAD27.  To do this, the t-sheets in the NAD27 projection were added to ArcMap 10.3.1 and the "Georeferencing" toolbar was opened. After locating a U.S. Standard Datum of 1915 graticule on the t-sheet, a mark was placed and the coordinates in degrees, minutes, seconds (DMS) format were entered. The t-sheet was then auto-corrected to the entered coordinate. This process was repeated for all remaining U.S. Standard Datum of 1915 graticules on each t-sheet. The t-sheets were shifted by calculating the change in latitude and longitude between the U.S. Standard Datum of 1915 graticules and a NAD27 gradicule. The shift values used were as follows: T-1371 (latitude by -0.00001, longitude by -0.00059), T-119 Part 1 (latitude by 0.045, longitude by 0.001709), and T-1084, T-1315a, and T-1333 (latitude by 0.0001, longitude by 0.0002). These values were entered into ArcMap’s "Shift" tool and the t-sheets were corrected to the correct NAD27 position. The t-sheets were checked to ensure shoreline positions matched from t-sheet to t-sheet.</procdesc>
