    <descript>
      <abstract>This data set consists of digital bathymetry contours for Lake Minnewashta in Dickinson Co., Iowa. The U.S. Geological Survey conducted a bathymetric survey of Lake Minnewashta in 2004.</abstract>
      <purpose>This digital, geographically referenced data set was developed by the U.S. Geological Survey to be used with the Lake Bathymetric project, Eastern Field Unit, Iowa City, Iowa.</purpose>
      <supplinf>Data collected during the bathymetric survey were input into a geographic information system (GIS) software package, ArcInfo, to create a point coverage representing discrete point locations. The point coverage was then used to generate a three-dimensional surface representing the lake-bottom elevations. This surface was then contoured and the contours were then adjusted to correct for interpretive errors.</supplinf>

        <procdesc>Water-surface elevation: Initial measurements determined the elevation of the water surface of Lake Minnewashta referenced to National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 using standard surveying techniques. A reference point (point from which to measure the water surface) elevation was established by leveling from a nearby existing reference mark with a known elevation (provided by Dickinson County Engineers Office). Accuracy of the existing reference mark is unknown. The reference point is located on the concrete outflow structure at the road junction at the lower end of Lower Gar Lake. The elevation of the reference point was found to be 1399.804 ft above NGVD29. The elevation of the reference point was verified by a static GPS survey (using the Ashtech GPS system) with a difference of 0.063 ft. Measuring from the reference point (using a steel tape), the water-surface elevation was found to be 1394.5 ft above NGVD29 on June 7, 2004.</procdesc>

      <procstep>
        <procdesc>Data collection: Bathymetry data were collected using the Bathymetric Survey System (BSS+5) with a 200-kHZ intelligent depth sounder (IDS) and a differential GPS (Novatel DGPS beacon or omnistar receiver) (Specialty Devices, Inc., 2003, Bathymetric Survey System BSS+5 with omnistar manual: Specialty Devices, Inc., Plano, Texas, 38 p.). The depth sounder emits pulses of sound that are reflected off the lake bottom and are received by a transducer. The differential GPS has a horizontal accuracy of about 1 meter (3.281 ft). Bathymetry and position data were collected and stored in Hypack Max software (ver. 2.12a) (Hydrographic Survey Software, User's Manual, Hypack Max, Coastal Oceanographics, Inc., Middlefield, Conn.). In Hypack Max, the geodetic parameters were set to UTM north, Zone 15, and ellipsoid GRS-1980. Distance (easting and northing) and depth units were both collected in feet. Current limitations of the Bathymetric Survey System (BSS+5) restrict data collection to depths greater than approximately 3.3 ft.

A bar check calibration on the echo sounder was performed at the start of each day following established protocols (U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 1994, Engineering and design: Hydrographic survey EM 1110-2-1003, chap. 9-3, p. 9-4 to 9-9). This was done to ensure that the echo sounder was calibrated correctly. The bar check involves suspending a 2-ft-diameter flat aluminum plate directly below the echo sounder. The suspension line is marked in 5-ft increments. An initial calibration is made at 5 ft by entering the speed of sound in water (based on water temperature) and then adjusting the offset of the transducer in the computer software. The offset is the draft of the transducer below the lake surface. The aluminum plate is then lowered in 5-ft increments (depending on the range of depths expected to be encountered on the day of data collection) and adjustments in the speed of sound are made until depth readings and the depth of the aluminum plate agree to within approximately 0.1 ft.

Bathymetry data were collected along planned transect lines that were set-up in Hypack Max using the internal line editor prior to data collection. Transect lines were spaced at 75-ft intervals perpendicular to the long axis of Lake Minnewashta. Depending on boat speed, bathymetry data points were collected at approximately 5- to 10-ft intervals. Data points may be much closer in areas where transect or perimeter runs overlap. Bathymetry data points also were collected while driving the boat once around the perimeter of the lake. The distance of the boat from shore during the perimeter run varied, depending upon the depths encountered, due to the depth limitations of the data-collection equipment. The raw bathymetry data were recorded in Hypack Max as depths (in feet below water surface to the lake bottom). Target points were collected in areas of the lake where it was too shallow to collect data with the BSS+5 system. Target point depths were collected manually, using a measuring device marked in 0.10-ft increments, along with a corresponding easting and northing location. Depending on lake-bottom type and surface conditions of the lake, accuracy of these measurements can vary between 0.05 ft and 0.5 ft. The number and location of target points were based on a judgment made in the field that was thought to be spatially representative of the area. In addition, shore point locations (easting and northing) were collected to define the shoreline of the lake. These locations are collected by touching the bow of the boat to the shoreline at various intervals along the shoreline and recording the position using a bow-mounted GPS antenna.

An independent bathymetry data set (in the coverage min_ctrlpts) also was collected over a smaller area of Lake Minnewashta. This control data set was used to estimate precision (repeatability) of the sounding data collected with the echo sounder. For Lake Minnewashta, there were 35 paired data and control points that were located within 1.5 ft of each other with a calculated Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.28 ft. The control data set also is used to estimate the accuracy of the produced contours.</procdesc>

      <procstep>
        <procdesc>Post-processing: Bathymetry data were processed using the Hypack Max software. Post-processing involved removing obvious spikes, inputting depths for the time-tagged target points, and editing extraneous points within the shore point files. In addition, tide corrections were applied in Hypack Max to convert raw sounding depths to elevation. The tide file subtracts the depths from the assigned lake-surface elevation (obtained from measurement from reference point elevation to lake water surface). The processed bathymetry data in Hypack Max were sorted and exported to XYZ format. The perimeter and transect bathymetry data were weeded (thinned) to reduce the density of points in one direction (along data-collection transects) to minimize the spatial pull of contours toward the densified lines. Of the original 7,768 data points, 2,659 data points remained. A total of three separate files were exported into XYZ format: (1) transect and perimeter bathymetry data; (2) shore point location data; and (3) the target point data. The XYZ files were then converted to ASCII text files for input into ESRI-ArcGIS (ver. 8.3). The perimeter and transect data were combined into one data set (min_allpts.txt). The file min_allpts.txt contains all processed data points (not weeded) exported from Hypack Max (not including edge and target points).</procdesc>

      <procstep>
        <procdesc>Generation of Bathymetry Map: The output text files (containing northing, easting, and elevation) were input into an arc macro language (AML) script called CREATEPOINT in ARC to generate three corresponding coverages (min_edgepts, min_tinpts, and min_targpts). The min_edgepts coverage contains the shore point locations. The min_tinpts coverage contains the weeded bathymetry points collected with the depth sounder. The min_targpts coverage contains the bathymetry target points collected manually. The projections for the coverages were then defined in ARC as UTM zone 15, NAD83, and units in feet. The coverage min_allpts contains unweeded bathymetry points generated from the min_allpts.txt file.

A polygon coverage (min_bndry) was created for the lake shore by first connecting (digitizing in ArcEdit) the points in the min_edgepts coverage. Digital orthophoto quads (DOQ's) (Iowa Department of Natural Resources, 2002-2003, Iowa 2002 Digital Orthophoto Update Project, information available on World Wide Web at URL http://www.igsb.uiowa.edu/nrgislibx/) were later used as an aid in further adjusting the coverage of the shoreline. From the polygon coverage min_bndry, a line coverage (min_bndelev) was created in ARC. An elevation field (elev) was then added to the attribute table of the min_bndelev coverage (min_bndelev.aat). In ArcEdit, the elev field of this coverage was set to a value of 1394.5 ft (lake-surface elevation). The coverages (min_bndry and min_bndelev) were defined in ARC as UTM zone 15, NAD83, with units in feet.

To generate contours and calculate lake volume, three-dimensional surfaces (TIN models) were created using 3-D Analyst in ArcMap. The TIN (min_tin) model was generated to create the preliminary contours. The point coverages, min_tinpts and min_targpts, were input into min_tin and triangulated as mass points. Height source was the "elevation" field in the point coverage attribute table. The min_bndelev line coverage was input as a hard line using the "elev" field as the height source (elevation value = 1394.5 ft). The min_bndry coverage (polygon) was input as a hard clip to clip the TIN to the lake shoreline. Another TIN model (min_tinsmooth) was later generated to re-calculate lake volume after the boundary coverages (min_bndry and min_bndelev) were further adjusted using DOQ's.

The TIN (min_tin) was used to generate the preliminary contours. The contours were generated in ARC using the TINCONTOUR command to generate the coverage min_bth_orig. The subdivision degree was set to 4 to specify the amount of triangular subdivision to help with the smoothing. Contour intervals were set at 2 ft with a base contour of 1381 ft. The minimum contour is 1381 ft and the maximum contour is 1393 ft. The coverage min_bth_orig was then copied to min_bth_cont. The min_bth_cont coverage was the edit coverage in ArcEdit where the contours were smoothed and adjusted for interpretive errors. The min_bth_orig coverage was used as a back coverage for comparison during editing in ArcEdit. Most interpretive adjustments and smoothing were done manually by adding, moving, or deleting vertices as needed. Contour movement was generally greatest in those contours with sharp bends.

The independent bathymetry data set (in the coverage min_ctrlpts) collected over a smaller area of Lake Minnewashta was used to estimate accuracy of the contours. For Lake Minnewashta, there were 45 paired contours and control points that were located within 0.5 ft of each other with a calculated Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.61 ft.

The volume for Lake Minnewashta was calculated in ArcMap/3-D Analyst using the min_tinsmooth TIN. The volume was calculated above a reference plane (lake-surface elevation) of -1394.5 ft. The TIN was inverted for calculation purposes only, following guidelines in ESRI-ArcGIS (ver. 8.3). ArcMap/3-D Analyst uses linear interpolation to calculate the area and volume of those portions of the TIN surface lying between the specified base value (lake-surface elevation) and the highest point in the TIN. Data from this survey show that the total surface area of Lake Minnewashta, at a water-surface elevation of 1,394.5 ft, is approximately 5,262,000 square feet (120 acres) and the total water volume of Lake Minnewashta is approximately 53,398,000 cubic feet (1,200 acre-ft).

          <attrvae>An independent bathymetry data set (in the coverage min_ctrlpts) collected over a smaller area of Lake Minnewashta was used to estimate accuracy of the contours. For Lake Minnewashta, there were 45 paired contours and control points that were located within 0.5 ft of each other with a calculated Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.61 ft.</attrvae>
