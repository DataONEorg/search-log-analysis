    <descript>
      <abstract>The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) conducts baseline and storm response photography missions to document and understand the changes in vulnerability of the Nation's coasts to extreme storms. On September 17, 2004, the USGS conducted an oblique aerial photographic survey from Crawfordville, Florida, to Petit Bois Island, Mississippi, aboard a Piper Navajo Chieftain aircraft at an altitude of 500 feet (ft) and approximately 1,000 ft offshore (Figure 2, http://pubs.usgs.gov/ds/0945/html/ds945_fig2.html). This mission was flown to collect data for assessing incremental changes since the last survey, flown July 2001 (http://compass.er.usgs.gov/activity_popup.php?id=2561), and can be used for assessing future coastal change. The photographs provided here are Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) images. The photograph locations are an estimate of the position of the aircraft and do not indicate the location of the feature in the images (see Navigation Data page, http://pubs.usgs.gov/ds/0945/html/ds945_nav.html). These photographs document the configuration of the barrier islands and other coastal features at the time of the survey. ExifTool (http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/) is a free software program for reading, writing, and manipulating image, audio, and video metadata. ExifTool was used to add the following to the header of each photo: time of collection, Global Positioning System (GPS) latitude, GPS longitude, keywords, credit, artist (photographer), caption, copyright, and contact information. Photographs can be opened directly with any JPEG-compatible image viewer by clicking on a thumbnail on the contact sheet. All image times are recorded in UTC. Table 1 (http://pubs.usgs.gov/ds/0945/html/ds945_table.html) provides detailed information about the assigned location, name, date, and time the photograph was taken along with a link to the photograph. In addition to the photographs, a Google Earth Keyhole Markup Language (KML) file is provided and can be used to view the images by clicking on the marker and then clicking on either the thumbnail or the link above the thumbnail.  The KML files were created using the photographic navigation files. Note: A KML number was assigned to each photograph to aid navigation of the Google Earth file. These numbers correspond to the site labels in Google Earth.</abstract>
      <purpose>To provide access to digital photographs taken as part of the September 17, 2004, post-Hurricane Ivan oblique aerial survey collected along the coast, from Crawfordville, Florida, to Petit Bois Island, Mississippi, and to provide access to attribute data that document the time and location of where each photograph was taken.</purpose>

      <attraccr>Best attempts were made to set the camera to UTC time on the GPS receivers at the beginning of each flight. The clock of the Compix Titler unit, which adds a caption to the bottom of the video stream for recording, was also set to UTC at the same time. Human error during transcription of geographic position and time from the video is possible; however, no obvious errors were observed. Latitude, longitude, and time were linearly interpolated from known navigation (collected once every 30 seconds) and time stamps (collected once every minute). NOTE: Latitude and longitude positions in this report refer to the position of the aircraft, not the position of the landmarks photographed.

    <logic>Data presented here include the digitally scanned analog and digitally collected photographs in JPEG format with EXIF headers imbedded and the location of the flight path of a post-Hurricane Ivan coastal oblique aerial photographic survey of the coast, from Crawfordville, Florida, to Petit Bois Island, Mississippi. This mission was flown on September 17, 2004, aboard a Piper Navajo Chieftain, tail number N2KK. Crew members of the USGS in St. Petersburg, Florida, include Karen L.M. Morgan, M. Dennis Krohn, Phillip Thompson, and Russell Peterson, with pilot, Mark Frame, of Bay Air Charters, Inc. Still photography was collected along the coast during this survey. Photographer: Karen L.M. Morgan. GPS Data Collection - Instrument: Trimble Centurion GPS and Precision Lightweight GPS Receiver. GPS Data Collection Interval: Two seconds (Trimble) and 30 seconds (PLGR). Data File Format: Text (ASCII). Number of files created: Two.  Computer/Software: None  Computer: None.
The GPS unit was used to record navigation fixes of the aircraft, not the position of the features imaged.  For a summary of field activity 04ACH03 please see http://coastal.er.usgs.gov/field-activity-schedule/activity_popup.php?id=2561.</logic>

        <procdesc>Anaolog (film) Photographs: Photographs were taken with two Nikon F3 cameras, each with a fixed 50-millimeter lens and a Skylight filter. One camera shot the odd-numbered rolls, and the other camera shot the even-numbered rolls. Both cameras were equipped with a Nikon MF-14 Data Back. Rolls were numbered by hand in the air. Film used was Kodak Ektachrome E6. Commonly used shutter speeds were 1/250 seconds or 1/125 seconds.  A constant shutter speed was attempted but may vary with there was a noticeable changes in light levels. The f-stop was changed to compensate for changes in light levels. The Nikon MF-14 Data Back imprinted day, hour, and minute (UTC) to the lower right-hand corner of each photo. All photographs were taken from the second-to-last rear starboard window of the airplane. Independent of all other equipment, a Rockwell Collins PLGR GPS recorded navigation fixes, at a 30-second interval, acquired from a National Marine Electronics Association (NMEA) string during the flight. These cameras' images are denoted by a "r###s##" in the file name.  The images are labeled with the following file name format: yyyy_mmdd_r###s##.jpg, where yyyy denotes the year, mmdd denotes the month and day, r### is the film roll number and s## is the slide number of the image. For example, image 2004_0917_r001s03.jpg was taken September 17, 2004, and is on the first roll of the flight, the third slide.</procdesc>

        <procdesc>Digital Photographs: Photographs were taken using a Nikon D1X camera.  Images were written directly to the camera&#8217;s internal cards. Best effort was made at the beginning of the flight to synchronize the camera's internal clocks to within 1 second of UTC time from the GPS sensor.  Image size is approximately 6 megapixels. Digital photographs were taken from the port side of the aircraft. Photographer: Karen L.M. Morgan. Note:  GPS locations indicate the position of the aircraft at the time of the photograph, not the position of the feature in the image. This camera's images are denoted by a "d" in the file name.  The images are labeled with the following file name format: yyyy_mmdd_hhmmss.jpg, where yyyy denotes the year, mmdd denotes the month and day, and hhmmss denotes hour, minute, and second of the image.

        <procdesc>The video was shot out of the rear starboard window of the airplane using a Sony DCR-VX1000 Handycam operated by Russell Peterson. The camera recorded the video on Mini DV tapes and sent the video signal to a Panasonic AG-5700 to record on SVHS tape. A Compix Titler unit added video subtitles that include latitude, longitude, and time (Hour:Minute:Second). Navigation was provided to the Compix by a Trimble Centurion GPS receiver, and time was provided by the titler unit's internal clock, which had been synchronized with UTC time. The SVHS video was digitally captured using Mac iMovie and divided into 5-minute segments consistent with the 5-minute HTML pages, each spanning a 5-minute section of the flight. Mini DV tapes were digitally captured using a Pioneer Elite Reference DVD Recorder DVR-7000 and saved to DVD. The video files are not included in this report.</procdesc>

        <procdesc>Slides were scanned using a Nikon Super CoolScan 5000 scanner and Nikon Scan 4 software. The slides were scanned using Digital Image Correction and Enhancement (ICE) technology at a resolution of 3000 dots per inch and files were saved as 18.6-megabyte TIFF images. The TIFF images were then converted to JPEG images at a resolution of 3000 dots per inch using Adobe Photoshop CS6. Digital ICE technology automatically removes artifacts, such as dust and scratches from scanned images.Slide names (year_monthday_roll number_slide number) and time (hour, minute) were manually entered into a Microsoft Excel 2011 spreadsheet. A Nikon MF-14 Data Back marked the time each photograph was acquired on the lower right corner of the image in day, hour, and minute format. It is assumed, for the purposes of location, that the photographs were taken at a constant rate during any given minute of flight. To assign a time value in seconds to each photograph, the number of photographs taken during each minute was evenly distributed across those 60 seconds. For example: if 15 photographs were taken during minute 19:00:00, we assume that a picture was taken every 4 seconds. The photographs were then assigned the time values 19:00:00, 19:00:04, 19:00:08, and so on. As a result, it should be noted that the positions assigned to each photograph are an estimate of the aircraft position, not the location of the landmark photographed. This file was named slides.xls. The photograph names provide information about the photograph's year, date, roll number, and slide number. For example, image 2004_0917_r001s03.jpg was taken September 17, 2004, and is on the first roll of the flight, the third slide. Only the JPEG images are included in this report.</procdesc>
