      <abstract>In March of 2008, the U.S. Geological Survey and St. Johns River Water Management District (SJRWMD) conducted geophysical surveys in Lakes Avalon, Big, Colby, Helen, Johns, Prevatt, Searcy, Saunders, Three Island, and Trout, located in central Florida. This report serves as an archive of unprocessed digital boomer seismic reflection data, trackline maps, navigation files, GIS information, FACS logs, and formal FGDC metadata. Filtered and gained digital images of the seismic profiles are also provided.

The archived trace data are in standard Society of Exploration Geophysicists (SEG) SEG-Y format (Barry and others, 1975) and may be downloaded and processed with commercial or public domain software such as Seismic Unix (SU). Example SU processing scripts and USGS software for viewing the SEG-Y files (Zihlman, 1992) are also provided.

For more information on the seismic surveys see http://walrus.wr.usgs.gov/infobank/j/j108fl/html/j-1-08-fl.meta.html

These data are also available via GeoMapApp (http://www.geomapapp.org/) and Virtual Ocean ( http://www.virtualocean.org/) earth science exploration and visualization applications.</abstract>
      <purpose>The data archived here were collected as part of the USGS Lakes and Coastal Aquifers (LCA) study.</purpose>
      <supplinf>The USGS Florida Integrated Science Center (FISC) - St. Petersburg assigns a unique identifier to each cruise or field activity. For example, 08LCA01 tells us the data were collected in 2008 for the Lakes and Coastal Aquifers (LCA) study and the data were collected during the first field activity for that study in that calendar year. Refer to http://walrus.wr.usgs.gov/infobank/programs/html/definition/activity.html for a detailed description of the method used to assign the cruise or field activity ID. The naming convention used for each seismic line is as follows: yye##a, where yy is the last two digits of the year in which the data were collected, e is a 1-letter abbreviation for the equipment type (for example, b for boomer), ## is a 2-digit number representing a specific track, and a is a letter representing the section of a line if recording was prematurely terminated or rerun for quality or acquisition problems.  The boomer plate is an acoustic energy source that consists of capacitors charged to a high voltage and discharged through a transducer in the water. The transducer is towed on a sled at the lake surface and when discharged emits a short acoustic pulse, or shot, that propagates through the water, sediment column, or rock beneath. The acoustic energy is reflected at density boundaries (such as the lake bottom, sediment, or rock layers beneath the lake bottom), detected by the receiver, and recorded by a PC-based seismic acquisition system. This process is repeated at timed intervals (for example, 0.5 s) and recorded for specific intervals of time (for example, 100 ms). In this way, a 2-D vertical image of the shallow geologic structure beneath the ship track is produced.  A C-Products C-Boom Low Voltage Boomer System contained a power supply, which provided 100 Joules per shot. Reflected energy was received by a Teledyne Instruments SDS-55 hydrophone array streamer and recorded by Triton Elics Delph Seismic v. 2.7 acquisition software. The streamer contains 10 hydrophones evenly spaced every 0.2 m. All phones were turned on during data acquisition. The streamer position varied each day, please refer to figure 1 included with this archive (Data Series 421) for a diagram of the acquisition geometries. Three boomer acquisition geometries were used during this survey. The second method was used because windy weather conditions hindered steerage, and driving the boat in reverse actually helped maintain course and prevented the possibility of the streamer cables becoming entangled in the boat propellers. The third method was used to help attenuate propeller and generator noise. The sample frequency of the data was 24 kHz, and record length varied between 50 and 100 ms. Based on survey speeds of approximately 2.5 knots and a shot rate of every 0.500 s, shot spacing was about 0.6425 m.  The unprocessed seismic data are stored in SEG-Y, integer, Motorola format, which is a standard digital format that can be read and manipulated by most seismic processing software packages (Barry and others, 1975). The SEG-Y formatted trace files have a .tra extension. Additional recording parameters for each trace file can also be found in the .par file associated with each .tra file. However, the .par files included here are only needed to process or display the data with Delph Seismic software. Also provided are example Seismic Unix scripts that allow the user to strip off navigation fixes from the SEG-Y headers, along with a fix for every 500 shots, and produce a filtered and gained GIF image of each profile.  The printable profiles provided here are GIF images that were filtered and gained using Seismic Unix software. The processed SEG-Y data were exported to Chesapeake Technology, Inc. (CTI) SonarWeb software to produce interactive versions of the profiles that allow the user to obtain a geographic location and depth from the profile for a cursor position. This information is displayed in the status bar of the browser. NOTE: The only supported Web browsers that properly display all features of the interactive profiles are Internet Explorer 6 or greater for Windows and Firefox 1.5 or greater for all platforms.

    <attracc>
      <attraccr>The validity or accuracy of marine seismic reflection profiles is highly qualitative and depends on equipment and operating condition variables. Visual inspection of the images rendered from the data did not show any major anomalies; however, no data were collected for trackline 08b138.</attraccr>
    </attracc>
    <logic>This data set is from one field activity with consistent instrument calibrations.</logic>
    <complete>These data are collected along tracklines (2-D) and are therefore inherently incomplete. Geologic details between lines must be inferred.</complete>
    <posacc>
      <horizpa>
        <horizpar>As the seismic reflection data were acquired, the position of the vessel was continuously determined by a Garmin GPS 18 WAAS receiver, which is accurate within 3 - 5 m. Positions were recorded and written to the trace headers in seconds of arc about every 1 s. The ASCII navigation files and trackline maps have not been corrected to reflect the approximately 5- to 10-m offset between the boomer and GPS antenna. Refer to figure 1 included with this archive for a diagram of the various acquisition geometries, including the GPS offset measurements. Line navigation maps and interactive profiles generated with CTI SonarWeb software have been corrected for the GPS offset.</horizpar>
      </horizpa>
      <vertacc>
        <vertaccr>Boomer data are relative to sea level. However, varying recorded static shifts of the data have been known to occur. Therefore, these data are not to be used for bathymetry.</vertaccr>

        <procdesc>Boomer processing: The SEG-Y data were processed with Seismic Unix to produce GIF images of the seismic profiles included in this report. A representative boomer processing sequence consisted of (1) running a bandpass filter of 300-500-2500-3000 Hz, (2) applying automatic gain control, (3) displaying PostScript, and (4) converting of PostScript image to a GIF image.  All the processed SEG-Y data were then exported to CTI SonarWeb software to produce an interactive version of each profile that allows the user to obtain a geographic location and depth for a cursor position on the profile. Refer to the Supplemental Information section above for details on how to use the interactive profiles.</procdesc>

      <procstep>
        <procdesc>Navigation processing: Shotpoint navigation files and 500-shot-interval location files were extracted from the trace headers of each line using Seismic Unix software. These files were then processed with PROJ.4 software (http://www.remotesensing.org/proj) to generate UTM coordinates from latitude and longitude coordinates and reformatted for use with Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI) GIS software.</procdesc>

      <procstep>
        <procdesc>Trackline map creation: The trackline maps provided in this archive were created using the Points to Lines ArcScript (D. Rathert, http://arcscripts.esri.com/details.asp?dbid=12702) along with ESRI ArcGIS 9.2 software and then exported to Adobe Illustrator for further editing. The maps were later converted into JPEG format by Adobe GoLive. The maps are unprojected (geographic coordinates, NAD83). The florida_cities, florida_interstates, and florida_roads layers used on the trackline maps were created by the Florida Division of Emergency, U.S. Census Bureau, and Geographic Data Technology, respectively. The USGS is the originator of all other layers used. A map of trackline navigation for each seismic profile was also produced with CTI SonarWeb software.</procdesc>
