      <supplinf>Introduction --

This data set consists of digital aquifer boundaries for the
alluvial and terrace deposits along the Cimarron River from
Freedom to Guthrie in northwestern Oklahoma. Ground water in
1,305 square miles of Quaternary alluvial and terrace deposits
along the Cimarron River from Freedom to Guthrie is an
important source of water for irrigation, industrial, municipal,
stock, and domestic supplies. Alluvial and terrace deposits are
composed of interfingering lenses of clay, sandy clay, and
cross-bedded poorly sorted sand and gravel. The aquifer is
composed of hydraulically connected alluvial and terrace
deposits that unconformably overlie Permian-age Formations
(Adams and Bergman, 1996).

The aquifer boundaries used by Adams and Bergman (1996), and
represented by this data set are: 1) where the terrace deposits
pinch out against relatively impermeable Permian-age Formations;
2) where the alluvium has been deposited against relatively
impermeable Permian-age Formations; 3) where the alluvial and
terrace deposits have been eroded and underlying Permian-age
Formations are exposed at the surface; 4) where the aquifer
extends beyond the geographic limit of the study area; and 5)
where the aquifer has little or no saturated thickness.

The aquifer boundaries were determined from the U.S. Geological
Survey publication "Geohydrology of alluvium and terrace
deposits of the Cimarron River from Freedom to Guthrie,
Oklahoma" by Adams and Bergman (1996). The aquifer boundaries
along geological contacts were extracted from digital geology
data sets by Cederstrand (1996a, 1996b, 1996c, 1996d).
Additional boundaries defining the geographic limits of the
aquifer and areas of less than 5 feet saturated thickness were
digitized from a mylar map, at a scale of 1:250,000. The maps
were published at a scale of 1:900,000.

Reviews Applied to Data --

This electronic report was subjected to the same review standard
that applies to all U.S. Geological Survey reports. Reviewers
were asked to check the topological consistency, tolerances,
attribute frequencies and statistics, projection, and geographic
extent. Reviewers were given digital data sets and paper plots
for checking against the source maps to verify the linework and
attributes. The reviewers checked the metadata and a_readme.1st
files for completeness and accuracy.

Related Spatial and Tabular Data Sets --

This data set is one of four digital map data sets being published
together for this aquifer. The four data sets are:

&gt;              aqbound -  aquifer boundaries

&gt;              cond    -  hydraulic conductivity

&gt;              recharg -  aquifer recharge

&gt;              wlelev  -  water-level elevation contours

Digital map data sets of the Oklahoma surficial geology
digitized from 1:250,000-scale maps (or 1:125,000-scale maps for
the three Oklahoma panhandle counties) are published separately.

    <useconst>Features representing aquifer boundaries along geological
contacts were extracted from the digital surficial geology data
sets by Cederstrand, (1996a, 1996b, 1996c, 1996d) based on a
scale of 1:250,000. Polygon boundaries defining the geographic
limits of the aquifer and areas of less than 5 feet saturated
thickness were digitized from a mylar source map (33 inches by
31 inches), at a scale of 1:250,000. Aquifer boundaries
represented at these scales are indicative of broad, regional
trends and should not be interpreted as site specific. The
aquifer boundaries that were digitized from a mylar source map
had a maximum root-mean-squared-error (RMSE) of 0.008 map inches
(0.020 map centimeters) or 167.49 feet (51.05 meters) ground
distance.

outcrops were included as part of the aquifer in the
finite-difference model grid, on figure 15. These Permian

purposes only and are not considered to be hydraulically
connected with the aquifer by Adams and Bergman (1996). These
Permian outcrops, for this report, are not considered part of
the aquifer. Aquifer boundaries with a value of 2 for the
LSOURCE line attribute were taken from Cederstrand (1996a,

digital geology data sets using the ARC/INFO GET command (ESRI,
1995). The ARC/INFO CLEAN command (ESRI, 1995) was used to
process the polygon data set with a dangle length of 0.0 feet
or meters and fuzzy tolerance of 3.3 feet (1.0 meters). The
ARC/INFO PROJECT command (ESRI, 1995) was used to convert the
extracted features data set projection from Albers Conical Equal

        <procdesc>Boundaries defining the geographic limits of the aquifer and
areas of less than 5 feet saturated thickness were digitized
from a mylar map, at a scale of 1:250,000. The mylar map was
based on Transverse Mercator projection, with central
meridians of 99 and 97 degrees west longitude. Registration
tics were located on the report data set and the mylar map at
locations of township and range corners, to allow registration
of the digitized data set and mylar map. The four registration
tics were projected into Universal Transverse Mercator-Zone
14, which was the projection used for manual digitizing. The
aquifer boundaries were digitized in three sessions with a
maximum root-mean-squared-error (RMSE) of 0.008 inches (0.020
centimeters) map distance or 167.49 feet (51.05 meters) ground
distance. The data set was edited to delete extraneous pseudo

        <procdesc>The registration tics used in the initial digitizing were
township and range corners taken from 1:24,000-scale
topographic maps. A comparison of a paper copy of the digital
data set with the source map showed that the 1:24,000-scale
township and range corners used as registration tics were not
in the same locations on the 1:250,000-scale source map. To
correct the problem, four 1:250,000-scale U.S. Geological
Survey quadrangle maps were registered using latitudinal and
longitudinal tics, with a maximum root-mean-squared-error
(RMSE) of 0.003 inches (0.008 centimeters) map distance or
69.09 feet (21.06 meters) ground distance. Forty-four
registration tics were selected and digitized from the
quadrangle maps, and given the same tic identification numbers
as the tics that were used initially. These new tics were used
with the ARC/INFO TRANSFORM command (ESRI, 1995) to adjust the
digitized tics to more closely match the source map. The
root-mean-squared-error (RMSE) for TRANSFORM was 189.3 feet
(57.7 meters) ground distance. The ARC/INFO PROJECT command
(ESRI, 1995) was used to convert the data set projection from
Universal Transverse Mercator-Zone 14 to Transverse Mercator,
with central meridians of 99 and 97 degrees west longitude. A
comparison of this transformed data set to the pretransformed
data set showed no difference in the digitized aquifer
boundaries.

        <procdesc>The ARC/INFO PROJECT command (ESRI, 1995) was used to convert
the data set projection from Universal Transverse
Mercator-Zone 14 to Albers Conical Equal Area. The data set
was changed from double to single precision with the ARC/INFO
COPY (single) command (ESRI, 1995). The ARC/INFO CLEAN command
(ESRI, 1995) was used to process the new polygon data set with
a dangle length of 0.0 feet or meters and fuzzy tolerance of
53.8 feet (16.4 meters). Polygons were attributed for AQTYPE
and lines were attributed for LSOURCE. Verification of
attribute codes were made by comparing a paper plot of the
data set with the source map.

    <overview>
      <eaover>Each polygon in this data set has an associated attribute,
AQTYPE, with values of 1 representing areas where the aquifer is
present, 2 representing areas where the aquifer is absent, and 3
representing areas where the aquifer was too thin (less than 5
feet of saturated thickness) for modeling ground-water flow by
Adams and Bergman (1996). AQTYPE is stored in the first major
code (MAJOR1) for polygons, and 0 is stored in the first minor
code (MINOR1) in the Digital Line Graph (DLG) version of this
data set.

Each line in this digital data set has an associated attribute,
LSOURCE, that contains a code to indicate the line source. A
LSOURCE code of 1 indicates the line was digitized from Adams
and Bergman (1996), and a LSOURCE code of 2 indicates the line
was extracted from Cederstrand (1996a, 1996b, 1996c, 1996d).
LSOURCE is stored in the first major code (MAJOR1) for lines,
and 0 is stored in the first minor code (MINOR1) in the Digital
Line Graph (DLG) version of this data set.
