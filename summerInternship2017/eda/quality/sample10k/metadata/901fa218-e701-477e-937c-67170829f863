      <supplinf>Introduction --

This data set consists of digital water-level elevation contours
for the alluvial and terrace deposits along the Cimarron River
in northwestern Oklahoma during 1985-86. Ground water in 1,305
square miles of Quaternary-age alluvial and terrace deposits
along the the Cimarron River from Freedom to Guthrie is an
important source of water for irrigation, industrial, municipal,
stock, and domestic supplies. Alluvial and terrace deposits are
composed of interfingering lenses of clay, sandy clay, and
cross-bedded poorly sorted sand and gravel. The aquifer is
composed of hydraulically connected alluvial and terrace
deposits that unconformably overlie the Permian-age Formations
(Adams and Bergman, 1996).

In this report, elevation refers to distance above sea level and
sea level refers to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929
(NGVD29)--a geodetic datum derived from a general adjustment of
the first-order level nets of both the United States and Canada,
formerly called Sea Level Datum of 1929. Water-level elevations
measured in 1985 and 1986 ranged from 1,650 feet to 950 feet
above sea level. Regional ground-water flow is generally
southeast to southwest towards the Cimarron River, except where
the flow direction is affected by perennial tributaries (Adams
and Bergman, 1996).

The water-level elevation contours were digitized from a mylar
map at a scale of 1:250,000 from the U.S. Geological Survey
publication, "Geohydrology of alluvium and terrace deposits of
the Cimarron River from Freedom to Guthrie, Oklahoma" by Adams
and Bergman (1996). The maps were published at a scale of
1:900,000.

Reviews Applied to Data --

This electronic report was subjected to the same review standard
that applies to all U.S. Geological Survey reports. Reviewers
were asked to check the topological consistency, tolerances,
attribute frequencies and statistics, projection, and geographic
extent. Reviewers were given digital data sets and paper plots
for checking against the source maps to verify the linework and
attributes. The reviewers checked the metadata and a_readme.1st
files for completeness and accuracy.

Related Spatial and Tabular Data Sets --

This data set is one of four digital map data sets being published
together for this aquifer. The four data sets are:

&gt;              aqbound -  aquifer boundaries

&gt;              cond    -  hydraulic conductivity

&gt;              recharg -  aquifer recharge

&gt;              wlelev  -  water-level elevation contours

Digital map data sets of the Oklahoma surficial geology
digitized from 1:250,000-scale maps (or 1:125,000-scale maps for
the three Oklahoma panhandle counties) are published separately.

    <useconst>This data set was digitized from a map published at a scale of
1:250,000. The map represents the elevation of the water
levels in the alluvial and terrace deposits along the Cimarron
River from Freedom to Guthrie, Oklahoma, in 1985-86.Water-level
elevations represented at this scale are indicative of broad,
regional trends and should not be interpreted as site
specific. The water-level elevation contours were digitized
from a mylar-source map (33 inches by 31 inches or 84
centimeters by 79 centimeters), with a root-mean-squared-error
(RMSE) of 0.008 map inches (0.020 map centimeters) or 167.49
feet (51.05 meters) ground distance.

        <procdesc>The water-level contours were digitized in three sessions with a
maximum root-mean-squared error (RMSE) of 0.008 inches (0.020
centimeters) map distance or 167.49 feet (51.05 meters) ground
distance. The contours were extended or clipped to meet the aquifer
boundaries of the associated AQBOUND data set. The data set was edited
to delete extraneous pseudo and dangle nodes. The ARC/INFO CLEAN
command (ESRI, 1995), was used with a dangle length of 3,281 feet
(1,000 meters) and fuzzy tolerance of 328 feet (100 meters).

        <procdesc>The registration tics used in the initial digitizing were township and
range corners taken from 1:24,000-scale topographic maps. A comparison
of a paper plot of the data set with the source map showed that the
registration tics were not in the same locations on the
1:250,000-scale source map. To correct the problem, four
1:250,000-scale U.S. Geological Survey quadrangle maps were registered
using latitudinal and longitudinal tics, with a maximum
root-mean-squared-error (RMSE) of 0.003 inches (0.008 centimeters) map
distance or 69.09 feet (21.06 meters) ground distance. Forty-four
registration tics were selected and digitized from the quadrangle
maps, and given the same tic identification numbers as the tics used
initially. These new tics were used with the ARC/INFO TRANSFORM
command (ESRI, 1995) to adjust the digitized tics to more closely
match the source map. The root-mean-squared-error (RMSE) for TRANSFORM
was 189.3 feet (57.7 meters) ground distance.

ARC/INFO COPY (single) command (ESRI, 1995). The ARC/INFO CLEAN
command (ESRI, 1995), was used to process the data set with a dangle
length of 0.0 feet or meters and fuzzy tolerance of 53.8 feet (16.4
meters). Water-level elevation contours were attributed for ELEV and
LTYPE. Verification of attribute codes were made by comparing a paper
plot of the data set with the source map.

    <overview>
      <eaover>Two attributes are associated with each line in this digital data
set. The first attribute, ELEV, contains the elevation of the
water-level contour, expressed in feet above the National Geodetic
Vertical Datum of 1929 (NGVD29). The second attribute, LTYPE, contains
the code 1, indicating the line is solid or the code 2, indicating the
line is dashed on the source map. ELEV is stored in the first major
code (MAJOR1) for lines, and LTYPE is stored in the first minor code
(MINOR1) in the Digital Line Graph (DLG) version of this data set.
