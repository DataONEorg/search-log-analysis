      <abstract>Hydrologic landscape regions group areas according to their similarity in landscape and climate characteristics.  These characteristics represent variables assumed to affect hydrologic processes in the environment.  Hydrologic landscape regions in Nevada were delineated using geographic information system tools and statistical methods including cluster analysis. The data layers of hydrogeology, precipitation, soil permeability, land surface slope and aspect were used to identify the hydrologic landscape regions. Sixteen hydrologic landscape regions were identified through cluster analysis. The hydrologic landscape regions are noncontiguous in nature and can range from small areas which tend to be in the mountain ranges to very large areas in the basins.</abstract>
      <purpose>This data set was created as part of a U.S. Geological Survey study, done in cooperation with the Nevada Division of Environmental Protection, to evaluate the susceptibility and vulnerability of ground water to anthropogenic contamination.  Hydrologic landscape regions group areas in Nevada according to their similarity in landscape and climate characteristics.  The landscape and climate characteristics represent factors assumed to affect hydrologic processes in the environment.  The intended uses of this data set include, but are not limited to, natural resource modeling, mapping, and visualization applications.</purpose>
      <supplinf>Hydrologic landscape regions group areas according to their similarity in landscape and climate characteristics.  These characteristics represent variables assumed to affect hydrologic processes in the environment.  Hydrologic landscape regions in Nevada were delineated using geographic information system (GIS) tools and statistical methods including cluster analysis.  One use of the hydrologic landscape regions was to select water quality sample sites throughout the state.
			
The data layers of hydrogeology, precipitation, soil permeability, land surface slope and aspect were used to identify the hydrologic landscape regions.  Hydrogeology and soil permeability describe the geologic texture, land-surface slope and aspect describe the land surface form, and precipitation describes the climatic setting.  For more information on the hydrogeologic landscape region process and theory see Maurer and others (2004).  
			
To identify hydrologic landscape regions the input data layers were generalized and then converted to raster format.  A raster processing function combined the multiple grids on a cell-by-cell basis such that a unique value is assigned to each unique combination of input values.  The resulting attribute table also includes the number of cells with each unique combination, and the values of each input grid.  The combination process produced 112 unique combinations which were examined and reduced using cluster analysis.  Cluster analysis is an exploratory data analysis tool for solving classification problems.  Its objective is to sort cases (things, people, events, etc) into groups, or clusters, so that the degree of association is strong between members of the same cluster and weak between members of different clusters.  Each cluster thus describes, in terms of the data collected, the class to which its members belong.  Each cluster identifies a hydrologic landscape region.  Cluster analysis identified 16 hydrologic landscape regions.  The initial 112 combinations were reclassed to the 16 hydrologic landscape regions and a filtering process was used to remove areas smaller than a 4 hectare minimum mapping unit.

    <attracc>
      <attraccr>The raster representation of precipitation, soil permeability, and hydrogeology were compared to their vector data sets graphically on screen or by plotting maps.  Land surface slope and aspect were compared with a shaded relief representation of the base elevation data set.  When data sets were grouped into a data range, the grouped data value was compared to the original data value at selected areas throughout the state in basin and range areas.  Combinations of the five grids were compared to the original data values at selected areas throughout the state.  After filtering was performed, the data set was compared to the data set before filtering.  All steps were determined to have been performed properly and exactly.</attraccr>

    <posacc>
      <horizpa>
        <horizpar>All attempts were made to compare the raster data representation to the original source data by visual inspection of selected areas.  All data is accurate within the 30 meter cell size when converted from vector data.  The accuracy of the source data for land surface slope and aspect is based on the National Elevation Dataset (NED) which is variable.  See ftp://edcftp.cr.usgs.gov/pub/data/ned/documents/NED_Release_Notes_Dec03.pdf for a complete description of digital elevation model horizontal data accuracy.  The accuracy of the source data for precipitation is based on the original specification of the Defense Mapping Agency 1 degree digital elevation models (DEM).  The stated accuracy of the DEM is 130 meter circular error with 90 percent probability.  The accuracy of the source data for hydrogeology is based on the 1:500,000-scale map product and deductively estimated at 260 meters.  The accuracy of the source data for soil permeability is based on the 1:250,000-scale map product and deductively estimated at 130 meters.</horizpar>

        <procdesc>The precipitation vector contour data was converted to ArcGIS TIN format using the ArcGIS createtin command.  The contour value was used to create the TIN Z value.  The TIN was converted to the GRID format with the ArcGIS tinlattice command using a linear interpolation maintaining an integer value.  The precipitation data set was resampled to 30 meter cell size by setting the ArcGIS GRID environment variables setcell and setwindow to the NED.</procdesc>

        <procdesc>The attribute GRID-CODE was added to the NVHYDGEOL data set.  It was populated with a value of 0 for high conductivity or 1 for low conductivity based on the attribute HYDGEOL.  High conductivity included unconsolidated formations except playas and the carbonate and basalt formations.  Low conductivity included rhyolite, andesite, breccia/tuff, intrusive/metamorphic, sandstone, siltstone, and tertiary sedimentary formations and playas. The data set was converted to raster format using the ArcGIS GRID polygrid function based on the attribute GRID-CODE and setting the environment variables setcell and setwindow to the NED.</procdesc>

        <procdesc>The input grids, except for hydrogeolgy, were grouped into more general categories using the ArcGIS GRID reclass function.  Lookup tables were created for soil permeability, precipitation, slope, and aspect data sets.  Soil permeability was grouped into the ranges of 0 to 5 feet per day, greater than 5 to 10 feet per day, and greater than 10 feet per day.  The soil permeability data set also had a unique code for waterbodies or no data.  Precipitation was grouped into 0 to 8 inches, greater than 8 to 16 inches, and greater than 16 inches.  Slope was grouped into 0 to 3 percent, greater than 3 percent to 25 percent, and greater than 25 percent.  Aspect was grouped into 60 to 330 degrees or southerly facing slopes and the ranges of 331 to 360 and 0 to 59 degrees or northerly facing slopes.  There was also a code for aspect if the cell had a level slope.  If the slope at a cell was less than 3 percent, the aspect was considered not significant and was coded as level aspect.</procdesc>

        <procdesc>The five grids were combined using the ArcGIS GRID combine function.  The value attribute table indicated a unique value for each unique combination, the number of cells with each value, and the input values of the five data sets.  The table was exported as a DBASE format file for input into the SAS statistical package for cluster analysis.</procdesc>

        <procdesc>See Maurer and others (2004) for a description of the cluster analysis.  A table was created from the results of the cluster analysis processing identifying the input combination number and the output cluster number.  A lookup table was created  for use in the ArcGIS GRID reclass function which mapped the 112 combinations to 16 cluster numbers.</procdesc>

        <procdesc>The filter process was achieved in multiple steps.  The ArcGIS GRID regiongroup function recorded for each cell in the output the identity of the connected region to which it belongs within the analysis window assigning a unique number to each region.  A mask grid was created by setting to null values those regions with less than 44 pixels or approximately 4 hectares, the minimum mapping unit.  The ArcGIS GRID nibble function was used with the mask grid which replaced areas in the original grid, identified by the mask grid null values, with the values of the nearest neighbors based upon Euclidean distance.
			
Due to computer program memory limitations, the filtering process was done in pieces based on 1:100,000-scale map quadrangle boundaries and then mosaicked back together.  The quadrangle boundaries were buffered by 1500 meters using the ArcGIS buffer command and converted to grid format using the ArcGIS GRID polygrid function.  This buffer represented more than the length a linear string of pixels could occupy and still have 44 contiguous pixels.  After filtering an area represented by the buffered map quadrangle, the processing environment mask was set to the original 1:100,000-scale map quadrangle boundary, in grid format, and clipped the buffered area to the original map quadrangle boundary.  All 1:100,000-scale map quadrangle grids were mosaicked back together using the ArcGIS GRID merge function.
			
Null values, resulting from the clipping, masking and mosaicking process, in the resulting hydrologic landscape region grid were replaced with an adjacent pixel value.  Values were calculated for the null values using the GRID focalmajority function with a 3-by-3 neighborhood.  Using the ArcGIS GRID condition function, if a null value was found in the hydrologic landscape region grid, it was replaced with the result of the focalmajority function.</procdesc>

Most waterbodies came from the USSOILS data except the Pahranagat Lakes, Adams-McGill Reservoir, Weber Reservoir, Toulon Lake, and Wild Horse Reservoir which came from the USGS digital line graphs (DLG).  The lakes were selected from each data set and combined into one data set using ArcGIS commands.  The waterbodies were then converted to raster format using ArcGIS GRID polygrid command and setting the environment variables setcell and setwindow to the NED.  The waterbodies were inserted into the final data set as null values using the ArcGIS GRID condition function.</procdesc>
