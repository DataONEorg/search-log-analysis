      <abstract>This digital-map data set consists of a grid of generalized skew
coefficients of logarithms of annual maximum streamflow for
Oklahoma streams less than or equal to 2,510 square miles in
drainage area.  This grid of skew coefficients is taken from figure
11 of the Tortorelli and Bergman, 1985 report, "Techniques for
estimating flood peak discharges for unregulated streams and
streams regulated by small floodwater retarding structures in
Oklahoma," U.S. Geological Survey Water-Resources Investigations
Report 84-4358. The skew coefficients were used to develop
peak-flow regression equations in the Tortorelli, 1997 report,
"Techniques for estimating peak-streamflow frequency for
unregulated streams and streams regulated by small floodwater
retarding structures in Oklahoma," U.S. Geological Survey
Water-Resources Investigations Report 97-4202. Only skew
coefficient values within Oklahoma are intended for use with the
regression equations. To save disk space, the skew coefficient
values have been multiplied by 100 and rounded to integers with two
significant digits.

      <purpose>This data set was used for estimation of peak-streamflow frequency
in Oklahoma by Tortorelli (1997). The skew coefficients from this
data set were used to develop the peak-flow regression equations,
and should be used to estimate peak flows in Oklahoma using the
regression equations in Tortorelli (1997). This data set includes
values outside Oklahoma that were used at selected stations for
regression analyses by Tortorelli (1997).  The regression equations
and this data set are intended for use only for sites within
Oklahoma.

Reviews_Applied_to_Data--

This electronic report was subjected to the same review standard
that applies to all U.S. Geological Survey reports.  Reviewers were
asked to check the topological consistency, tolerances, attribute
frequencies and statistics, projection, and geographic extent.
Reviewers were given digital data sets and paper plots for checking
against the source maps.  The reviewers were asked to check the
metadata and accompanying files for completeness and accuracy.
Related_Spatial_and_Tabular_Data_Sets--

This data set is one of two digital map data sets being published
for this report.  The two data sets are:

skewgrid - generalized peak streamflow skew coefficients

maprecip - mean annual precipitation

These data sets were used in regression analyses by Tortorelli
(1997), and are being published so the data sets may be used to
apply the regression equations to estimate peak streamflow
frequencies.

    <useconst>This data set was digitized from a 1:500,000-scale mylar draft map,
which was photo-reduced and published by Tortorelli and Bergman
(1985) at a scale of 1:2,500,000. The skew coefficients are
generalized, and, therefore, may not be representative of individual
station skew coefficients. Although skew coefficients from some
stations outside Oklahoma were used to develop the generalized skew
map by Tortorelli and Bergman (1985), the skew values are intended
for use to develop peak-streamflow frequency curves for gaged sites
only within Oklahoma.

        <procdesc>Lines of equal average skew coefficient
were digitized from the original 1:500,000-scale mylar draft
used to make figure 11 in Tortorelli and Bergman (1985).
Registration tics were taken from latitudinal and longitudal
marks. The root-mean-square error for tic-mark registration
was 0.009 inches. A line was added forming a loop on the -0.3
line in the northwest, to correctly represent the depression
in the  skew-coefficient surface. The map was digitized by
Marvin Abbott.

        <procdesc>The lines of equal average skew coefficient
were projected from Lambert Conformal Conic map projection to
Albers Equal Area, using standard parallels selected for
Oklahoma, and the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83) for
the horizontal datum. Projection was done by Alan Rea.

        <procdesc>The lines of equal average skew
coefficient were processed into a grid using TOPOGRID, a
module of ARC/INFO (ESRI, 1995), revision 7.0.3. An output
cell size of 1,000 meters was used. The tolerances used were:
0.001 for root mean square residual, 0.05 for "tol1", and 0.1
for "tol2". TOPOGRID processing was done by Alan Rea.

        <procdesc>To save disk space, the values in the
grid were multiplied by 100 and rounded to integers with two
significant digits. For example, a skew coefficient of -0.215
is represented in this data set as -22. To correct for data
values extrapolated by TOPOGRID, all values larger than 50
(skew coefficient of 0.5) were changed to 50, and all values
smaller than -50 were changed to -50. Values smaller than -20
(skew coefficient of -0.2) in southwestern Oklahoma were
changed to -20. This processing step was done by Alan Rea.
