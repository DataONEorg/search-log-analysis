      <abstract>The U.S. Geological Survey has developed a method for estimating the mobility and potential alongshore transport of heavier-than-water sand and oil agglomerates (tarballs or surface residual balls, SRBs).  During the Deepwater Horizon spill, some oil that reached the surf zone of the northern Gulf of Mexico mixed with suspended sediment and sank to form sub-tidal mats. If not removed, these mats can break apart to form SRBs and subsequently re-oil the beach.  A method was developed for estimating SRB mobilization and alongshore movement.  A representative suite of wave conditions was identified from buoy data for April, 2010, until August, 2012, and used to drive a numerical model of the spatially-variant alongshore currents.  Potential mobilization of SRBs was estimated by comparing combined wave- and current-induced shear stress from the model to critical stress values for several sized SRBs. Potential alongshore flux of SRBs was also estimated to identify regions more or less likely to have SRBs deposited under each scenario.  This methodology was developed to explain SRB movement and redistribution in the alongshore, interpret observed re-oiling events, and thus inform re-oiling mitigation efforts.</abstract>
      <purpose>This GIS layer contains an estimate of the locations of spatial decelerations in the direction of flow in the maximum (in terms of absolute value) alongshore current in the shallow northern Gulf of Mexico (Alabama and portion of the Florida coast) for a single set of wave conditions. These decelerations are defined as locations where there is a significant decrease in the spatial acceleration (u*du/dy) moving in the direction of flow, or, conceptually, where a particle moving with the flow would encounter a reduced flow velocity as it moved from one grid cell to the next.  This output is based on numerical model output of wave and circulation patterns for a given wave height scenario, corresponding to a particular set of offshore wave conditions at 
        <abbr title="National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration">NOAA</abbr> NDBC buoy 42040. The specific wave conditions for a given layer are indicated by the file name (of format Hh_Dd_decel), also found in the shapefile attributes,  and may be found by comparing the scenario name (Hh_Dd) to the look-up table included in the GIS zip file, wave_scenarios.txt. This data layer is intended to show patterns in alongshore current for intended use by individuals in SRB mitigation attempting to explain redistribution of SRBs under specific wave conditions.

      <supplinf>This data layer is a subset of USGS Open-File Report 2012-1234, Hydrodynamic and Sediment Transport Model Application for OSAT3 Guidance.  It is part of a set of data layers describing decelerations in the maximum (in terms of absolute value) alongshore current for a range of wave climate scenarios.  The specific wave conditions and object parameters for this layer are indicated by the file name (of format Hh_Dd_decel), and in the shapefile attributes, and may be found by comparing the scenario name (Hh_Dd) to the look-up table included in the GIS zip file, wave_scenarios.txt.</supplinf>

The D-Flow and D-Waves components of the Deltares Delft3D numerical model suite (version 4.00.01) were used to estimate east and north components of wind and wave-driven velocity for the offshore wave conditions corresponding this scenario Hh_Dd (characteristics of which may be found in the included wave_scenarios.txt file) in each grid cell in the model domain.  The wave model D-Waves, based on the Simulating WAves Nearshore (SWAN) model, is a 3rd generation phase-averaged numerical wave model which conserves wave energy subject to generation, dissipation, and transformation processes and resolves spectral energy density over a range of user-specified frequencies and directions.  D-Wave was used in stationary mode.  D-Flow solves the shallow water Navier Stokes equations and is run in 2-D depth-averaged mode, with linkage to D-Waves allowing the generation of wave-driven currents via wave radiation stress forcing.  Default values for model parameters governing horizontal viscosity, bottom roughness, and wind drag were used.  Neumann boundary conditions were used along the east, west, and south model boundaries with harmonic forcing set to zero.  Model bathymetry was provided by the 
          <abbr title="National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration">NOAA</abbr> National Geophysical Data Center Northern Gulf Coast digital elevation map, referenced to NAVD88.

Significant wave height, dominant wave period, and wave direction were prescribed as D-Wave TPAR format files every 30 grid cells along the  model boundary using results from the 
          <abbr title="National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration">NOAA</abbr> Wavewatch III 4' multi-grid model for a representative moment in time corresponding to the offshore wave conditions of the scenario, the specific time of which may be found in the included wave_scenarios.txt file.  A JONSWAP (JOint NOrth Sea WAve Project) spectral shape was assumed at these boundary points.  Wind forcing was provided using the archived WavewatchIII 4' winds, extracted from the 
          <abbr title="National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration">NOAA</abbr> GFS wind model, for this time.  The D-Wave directional space covers a full circle with a resolution was 5 degrees (72 bins).  The frequency range was specified as 0.05-1 Hz with logarithmic spacing.  Bottom friction calculations used the JONSWAP formulation with a uniform roughness coefficient of 0.067 m2/s3.  3rd-generation physics are activated which accounts for wind wave generation, triad wave interactions and whitecapping (via the Komen et al parameterization).  Depth-induced wave breaking dissipation is included using the method of Battjes and Janssen with default values for alpha (1) and gamma (0.73).  Current model outputs of east and north current velocity component were extracted and interpolated to the wave model grid (staggered points in relation to the current model grid).

NDBC observations from station 42012 for the representative scenario time periods were used to validate the wave model results.

Identify the spatial extent of the surf zone at each alongshore location using Mathworks MATLAB software (v2012A).  The shoreline is identified from the gridded bathymetry as the cross-shore grid cell of minimum water depth at each alongshore transect.  In areas where lagoons separate barrier islands and the mainland coast, the shoreline is considered along the seaward side of the barrier island only.  The shoreline is not continuous due to interruptions at inlets.

For each alongshore transect, the surf zone is defined as the area between the shoreline and the location of maximum wave height (found in a search area extending from the shoreline to the most offshore point of modeled depth-induced wave breaking dissipation).  The extent of the surf zone (as indices into the grid at each alongshore location of the cross-shore position of the shoreline and seaward edge of the surf zone) was saved for all of the scenarios into a MATLAB .mat structure.

The maximum (in terms of magnitude) alongshore current within the surf zone at each alongshore location was
computed in Mathworks MATLAB v2012A using modeled flow velocities.  The alongshore variant maximum velocity vector was then smoothed with a 2-km Hanning window filter to remove small-scale variations likely caused by model noise.

        <procdesc>Spatial decelerations in the direction of flow (e.g., the flow velocity decreases from one grid cell to the adjacent cell in the direction of flow) are defined using an advective acceleration term defined as u*du/dy where u is the alongshore current and y is the alongshore grid coordinate. A derivative of the alongshore velocity (u) is computed and used to identify locations where the flow is decelerating (du/dy &lt; 0).  We save locations corresponding to peak deceleration (convex points in du/dy) and the magnitude of u*du/dy at the identified points is also recorded.

        <procdesc>Export the values for each alongshore location from MATLAB format into an ArcGIS point shapefile using the Mathworks MATLAB Mapping Toolbox (v2012A).  The latitude and longitude coordinates correspond to the identified shoreline location for each alongshore location.  A single "converge" attribute is given a value of one; all latitute and longitude points in the file are convergence locations.  The shapefile is written with the "shapewrite" command.  Because MATLAB does not assign a projection, the projection corresponding to the projection associated with the bathymetry used in the numerical models is added in ArcCatalog 9.3.  The file was then quality checked in ArcMap to insure values were properly exported to the shapefile from MATLAB.</procdesc>
