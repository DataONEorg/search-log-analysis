      <abstract>This Data Series Report contains lidar elevation data collected September 5 to October 11, 2012, for the barrier islands of Alabama, Mississippi and southeast Louisiana, including the coast near Port Fourchon.  Most of the data were collected September 5-10, 2012, with a reflight conducted on October 11, 2012, to increase point density in some areas.
Lidar data exchange format (LAS) 1.2 formatted point data files were generated based on these data. The point cloud data were processed to extract bare earth data; therefore, the point cloud data are organized into only four classes: 1-unclassified, 2-ground, 7-noise and 9-water.
Aero-Metric, Inc., was contracted by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) to collect and process these data.
The lidar data were collected at a nominal pulse spacing (NPS) of 1.0 meter (m).
The horizontal projection and datum of the data are Universe Transverse Mercator, zones 15N and 16N, North American Datum 1983 (UTM Zone 15N or 16N NAD83), meters. The vertical datum is North American Vertical Datum 1988, Geoid 2012 (NAVD88, GEOID12), meters.
These lidar data are available to Federal, State and local governments, emergency-response officials, resource managers, and the general public.</abstract>
      <purpose>The lidar survey was acquired to document the changes of several different barrier island systems resulting from Hurricane Isaac.  This survey supports detailed studies of Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama barrier islands that resolve annual and episodic changes in beaches, berms and dunes associated with processes driven by storms, sea-level rise, and even human restoration activities.</purpose>
      <supplinf>Lidar data acquisition, calibration, and follow-on processing were completed by Aero-Metric, Inc. Aero-Metric was contracted by the USGS to conduct the work.
The file naming convention is based on a 2-kilometer (km) by 2-km tiling scheme. The geographic extent of each tile falls on even 2000 x and y UTM zone 15N or 16N, NAD83, meters, coordinates. The first two digits of the file name represent the UTM zone.  The last eight digits are based on the lower-left (LL) xy coordinates of the tile.  For example, tile name 15_69802160 uses 6980 to represent an LL x-coordinate of 698,000, and uses 2160 to represent an LL y-coordinate of 3,216,000 (ignoring the first digit).</supplinf>

        <vertaccr>The USGS conducted ground surveys in a small area on Chandeleur Island on September 6, 2012, one on bare earth and another in mixed bare earth and vegetated areas.
The USGS calculated a vertical root mean square error (RMSEz) of 0.072 m (m) and an offset of 0.007 m using interpolated 2-m by 2-m resolution grid surfaces made from lidar bare-earth data and the combined USGS ground surveys.
The contractor was required to achieve a fundamental vertical accuracy (FVA) of 24.5 centimeters (cm), 95 percent (12.5 cm RMSEz); a consolidated vertical accuracy (CVA) of 36.3 cm, 95th percentile; and a target value for supplemental vertical accuracies (SVA) of 36.3 cm, 95th percentile.  Aero-Metric's vertical accuracy assessment was as follows:
The FVA of the LAS swath data achieved 5.0 cm at a 95 percent confidence level with an RMSEz of 2.5 cm utilizing (2280) ground survey check points provided by the USGS.
The SVA results in an area of open terrain achieved 4.8 cm at the 95th percentile where (2280) ground survey check points provided by the USGS were evaluated.
The SVA results in an area of vegetation achieved 10.7 cm at the 95th percentile where (2421) ground survey check points provided by the USGS were evaluated.
The CVA results for all land cover classes, ground and vegetation combined, achieved 7.3 cm at the 95th percentile where (4700) checkpoints were evaluated.
The USGS also conducted a terrestrial lidar survey on Dauphin Island, Louisiana, on September 3, 2012.
The USGS calculated an RMSEz of 0.32 m and an offset of 0.27 m using interpolated 2-m by 2-m resolution grid surfaces from the airborne lidar bare-earth data and the terrestrial lidar survey.</vertaccr>

        <procdesc>Lidar Pre-Processing:  The point cloud data was imported into TerraScan in a Microstation V8 (V) CAD environment on a specified 2000 m by 2000 m tiling scheme.
The data were analyzed for overall completeness and consistency.  The data were then inspected for calibration errors with TerraMatch software.
This was accomplished by sampling the data collected across all flight lines and classifying the individual lines to ground.
The software used the ground-classified lines to compute calibration corrections for heading, pitch, roll, and scale, which were then applied to the dataset.
USGS ground surveys from a small area on the Chandeleur Islands, Louisiana, were used to test the accuracy of the lidar ground surface.
TerraScan's Output Control Report (OCR) was used to compare the quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) data to the lidar data.
This routine searches the lidar dataset by x,y coordinates, finds the closest lidar point and compares the vertical (z) values to the known data collected in the ground survey.
Based on the QA/QC data, necessary bias adjustments were made to the lidar data.</procdesc>

        <attrdef>The Scan Direction Flag denotes the direction at which the scanner mirror was traveling at the time of the output pulse. A bit value of 1 is a positive scan direction, and a bit value of 0 is a negative scan direction, where positive scan direction is a scan moving from the left side of the in-track direction to the right side and negative the opposite.</attrdef>

        <attrdef>The Scan Angle Rank is a signed one-byte number with a valid range from -90 to 90.
The Scan Angle Rank is the angle (rounded to the nearest integer in the absolute value sense) at which the laser point was output from the laser system including the roll of the aircraft.
The scan angle is within 1 degree of accuracy from -90 to 90 degrees.
Zero degrees is the nadir and -90 degrees is to the left side of the aircraft in the direction of flight.</attrdef>

The numerical value corresponds to the File Source ID from which this point originated. Zero is reserved as a convenience to system implementers. A Point Source ID of zero implies that this point originated in this file. This implies that processing software should set the Point Source ID equal to the File Source ID of the file containing this point at some time during processing.</attrdef>
