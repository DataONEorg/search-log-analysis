Microbial biomass N was measured on replicate soil cores from plots of  each community, using the chloroform fumigation-extraction technique.  Those cores were subsequently composited and subsamples were incubated  at 15 degrees Celsius in the laboratory for measurement of CO2 evolution  and 15N pool dilution-based estimations of gross mineralization.</para></abstract><keywordSet><keyword>NWT</keyword><keyword>Niwot Ridge LTER Site</keyword><keyword>LTER</keyword><keyword>Colorado</keyword><keyword>N</keyword><keyword>N immobilization</keyword><keyword>N turnover</keyword><keyword>biomass</keyword><keyword>gross mineralization</keyword><keyword>immobilization</keyword><keyword>microbial biomass N</keyword><keyword>microbial respiratio</keyword><keyword>mineralization</keyword><keyword>respiration</keyword></keywordSet><distribution scope="document"><online><url function="download">http://culter.colorado.edu/exec/.extracttoolA?grossmin.mf</url></online></distribution><coverage scope="document"><temporalCoverage scope="document"><rangeOfDates><beginDate><calendarDate>1993-06-10</calendarDate></beginDate><endDate><calendarDate>1993-10-15</calendarDate></endDate></rangeOfDates></temporalCoverage><geographicCoverage scope="document"><geographicDescription></geographicDescription><boundingCoordinates><westBoundingCoordinate>-105.643</westBoundingCoordinate><eastBoundingCoordinate>-105.3753</eastBoundingCoordinate><northBoundingCoordinate>40.0615</northBoundingCoordinate><southBoundingCoordinate>39.9932</southBoundingCoordinate></boundingCoordinates></geographicCoverage></coverage><maintenance><description><para>The original iteration of the documentation section of this file was provided by Melany Fisk in an email message from  1 February 1994.[RCI 17 February 1994] Data for 1993 were appended to the data section on 18 February 1994 and the file was put under sccs control then, as well.[18 February 1994] Trace gas plot  locations surveyed by Tim Bardsley and Mike Hartman on 6 July 1994  were added to the comments section on 14 July 1994.[RCI 14 July 1994] Several editorial revisions for the documentation and header sections suggested by Melany Fisk were incorporated into those sections on 18 January 1995.
