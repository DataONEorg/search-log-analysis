      <abstract>This report consists of two-dimensional marine seismic reflection profile
data from the upper and middle Florida Keys. The area of operations extended from just north of Molasses Reef off north Key Largo (Upper Keys) to the east boundary of Looe Key National Marine Sanctuary (Lower Keys). These data were acquired in October and November of 1997 with the Charter Vessel Captain's Lady. The data are available in a variety of formats, including binary, ASCII, HTML, Shapefiles, JPG and GIF images.
Binary data are in Society of Exploration Geophysicists (SEG) SEG-Y format and may be downloaded for further processing or display. Reference
maps and JPG images of the profiles may be viewed with your WWW browser.

For more information on the seismic surveys see http://walrus.wr.usgs.gov/infobank/c/c197fl/html/c-1-97-fl.meta.html

These data are also available via GeoMapApp (http://www.geomapapp.org/) and Virtual Ocean (http://www.virtualocean.org/) earth science exploration and visualization applications.</abstract>
      <purpose>Marine seismic reflection data are used to image and map sedimentary and structural features of the seafloor and subsurface. These data are useful in mapping the extent and thickness of shallow sedimentary units in the upper and middle Florida Key, and in assessing other submarine geologic characteristics and features. The main objective of this cruise was to fill a major gap in the seismic data record. Data had not been collected for this area at any time during a 20-year study of the reef track.</purpose>
      <supplinf>Seismic reflection profiles are acquired by means of an acoustic source (usually generated electronically), and a hydrophone or hydrophone array. Both elements are typically towed in the water behind a survey vessel. The sound source emits a short acoustic pulse, which propagates through the water and sediment columns. The acoustic energy is reflected at density boundaries (such as the seafloor or sediment layers beneath the seafloor), and detected at the hydrophone. This process is repeated at intervals ranging between 100 ms and 1s depending on the source type. In this way a two-dimensional image of the geologic structure beneath the ship track is constructed. Seismic data are stored in SEG-Y format, which is a standard digital format that can be read and manipulated by most seismic-processing software packages. The SEG-Y file format includes a 3200-byte descriptive header that contains detailed information regarding the data acquisition and processing parameters. All data presented here are stored in SEG-Y, Integer, Motorola format. The SEG-Y formatted trace data files have a .tra extension. Additional recording parameters for each seismic data file can also be found in the .par file associated with each .tra file. However, the .par files and the plg_gga.pln file are only needed to replay the data with Triton Elics Delph Seismic software. The seismic source employed here consisted of a boomer transducer towed on a sled at the sea surface providing 100 joules per shot. The reflected energy was received by an Innovative Transducer Inc. (ITI) solid core streamer and recorded by PC-based Triton-Elics Delph Seismic acquisition software. The ITI streamer contains 10 hydrophones evenly spaced over 6 meters however only data received by elements 5-8 where summed, resulting in a higher signal to noise ratio for the data. The streamer was positioned parallel to the boomer sled and laterally separated from it by 7 m. The sled was towed 20 m behind the GPS antennae. The sample frequency of the data was 12000 Hz and the total record length was 100 ms. The fire rate was every 0.25 sec, which resulted in a shot spacing of about 0.5 m based on survey speeds of 3.5-4 knots. P-Code GPS navigation was fed to the acquisition system every second by a Rockwell navigation receiver. The accuracy of this receiver is within 100 m. However, the data required some editing. A filter was designed to remove spurious data values and these edited results can be used to generate trackline maps at any scale or projection desired, however the shotpoint data has not been corrected to reflect the 20 m offset between the source and the GPS antenna. Also the raw navigation files did not have year or julian day written to the headers. This information was handwritten into the edited and shotpoint navigation files. Position fixes for every 500th shotpoint and the start and end of line are also provided as an aide for easy registering of the data after projection. The trackline maps provided in this report are geographic projections and were created using ESRI's GIS software ArcView 3.2 and exported to Adobe Illustrator for further editing, then saved as GIF images. These GIF images are viewable with your WWW browser. All navigation files are stored as flat ASCII text files. Included on this disc are GIS files created with ESRIs Arcview 3.2, displaying the shotpoint information for each seismic trackline. These files are compatible with either ArcView 3.x (UNIX or WINDOWS) or ArcGIS 8.1 (WINDOWS). The files can also be viewed using the Windows compatible public domain software ArcExplorer 2.0, and 4.0. To download a free copy of ArcExplorer go to the ESRI website (http://www.esri.com/software/arcexplorer/index.html). Field Activity Collection System (FACS) logs are available in both html and Rich Text format, along with the scanned GIF images of the original logbooks.</supplinf>

    <datacred>The USGS Coastal and Marine Geology Program (CMGP) provided  the funding for research east and northeast of the Looe Key National Marine Sanctuary  (LKNMS), to Molasses Reef off the upper Keys. Billy Causey, Superintendent of the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary (FKNMS), and Sanctuary Rangers (Florida Department of Natural Resources, Bureau of Environmental Land Management) are thanked for their cooperation during the field survey. Personnel from the USGS in St. Petersburg, Fla., and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrations (NOAA) FKNMS conducted most of the project in the middle and upper Keys as a cooperative study under permit FKNMS-29-97. We thank Captain Stephen R. Cawthon who led Captain's Lady on her final voyage as a research vessel in 1997, for assistance in data collection. Appreciation is extended to numerous colleagues for their field assistance. All are acknowledged by name in publications resulting from each part of the project. Stanley D. Locker, University of South Florida St. Petersburg campus, assisted in numerical data conversion to compensate for the rapid speed-of-sound return in shallow water. James G. Flocks, USGS geologist, produced the seismic-profile trackline navigation and data map panels for contouring. Digital cartographer Lance E. Thornton digitized final contours into the ARC/INFO GIS program for the bedrock and isopach plates. Jeff Dismukes provided scripts for editing and reformatting  the navigation data for use with ESRIs ArcView 3.2. The authors greatly appreciate the efforts of these colleagues.</datacred>

      <attraccr>The validity or accuracy of marine seismic reflection profiles is highly qualitative, and depends on equipment and operating condition variables. After visual inspection of the JPG images provided in this report these notes must be made about the data. Important Notes: 1.Seismic Profiles key9717b, key9717c, key9717d, key9718a, key9718b, key9723a and key9728a contain deep water delays ranging from 10 ms to 40 ms. 2.Also small 0.5 ms to 2 ms static shifts are seen in all profiles. These shifts vary for each profile and last for short irregular periods of time. 3.Only 70 ms of data was collected for trackline key9717c; all other lines were collected with 100 ms of data saved. 4.Trackline key9716t contains no usable data; it was a test line.</attraccr>

      <eaover>Binary data file: Each profile is available as a binary file in Society of Exploration Geophysicists SEG-Y format. A SEG-Y file consists of 1) a 3200-byte file identification record of ASCII formatted general information; 2) a 400-byte binary record with information such as sample rate and record length specific to the data set; and 3) multiple records, one seismic reflection trace per record. Each trace record is preceded by a 240-byte "trace header" containing information such as trace number and acquisition day and time specific to each trace. The trace data are represented as a time series of unitless 16-bit integer or 32-bit real numbers proportional to the reflection coefficient. The SEG-Y file is useful only if you have access to specialized software designed to process and display seismic reflection data. These SEG-Y files have a .tra extension. These .tra files range in size from the smallest being 14 MB to the largest being 142 MB.</eaover>
      <eaover>Graphic image file: Each profile is available as a GIF or JPG image. The trackline maps provided are GIF images that contain hot-links to the seismic profile JPG images. The profiles range in size from 1.1 MB to 8.9 MB.</eaover>
