    <abstract>
      <para>
  This database is from regular monitoring of water level and surface
  ice cover at Frank B. Cross Reservoir, a small freshwater impoundment
  in northeastern Kansas (USA). Cross Reservoir, located at the
  University of Kansas Field Station near Lawrence (KS), has a 3-ha
  surface area and a maximum depth of 12 m. Measurements of water
  elevation and estimates of ice cover were made at semi-monthly
  intervals (i.e., roughly every two weeks). The first data were taken
  in December 1993, shortly after the reservoir was constructed and
  first filled to capacity. Water levels were measured relative to a
  permanent water control structure. Ice cover observations were visual
  estimates of the percent (%) surface of the reservoir covered with
  ice. Water level measurements and ice cover estimates are made at the
  same time.

          <para>
  Measurements were made at regular two-week intervals as close to the
  first and the fifteenth of each month as possible. Additional
  measurements may have been taken on an opportunistic basis to document
  episodic phenomena (e.g., following a heavy rain). Occasionally there
  is a missing sampling event such that the interval between sampling is
  approximately one month. Data are recorded on standard data forms and
  archived at the University of Kansas Field Station headquarters, and
  at the Kansas Biological Survey (Higuchi Hall, Lawrence, KS). In
  addition to water level and ice cover, field sheets may contain
  miscellaneous observations and notes.

          <para>
  Water elevation
</para>
          <para>
  Water level (elevation) is recorded relative to the top of a concrete
  water control structure (which is a 61 cm [24 inch] diameter vertical
  tube encased in concrete near the dam). Water levels below the top of
  the concrete standpipe are recorded as a negative value, and water
  levels above the top of the concrete standpipe are recorded as a
  positive value. Our method called for a measurement to the nearest
  inch relative to the top of the overflow tube. However, frequently the
  data were recorded to the nearest 0.5 inch, particularly for
  elevations near zero. If water is above the top of the tube the
  measurement is recorded as a positive number, or if water is below the
  tube it is recorded as a negative number. A special case occurs when
  the water level is recorded as zero. For those cases a notation is
  made (as yes or no on the data sheet) as to whether water is running
  (often referred to as trickling) into the standpipe.
</para>
          <para>
  Ice cover
</para>
          <para>
  Ice cover on the reservoir is visually estimated as the percent
  (percent) of the reservoir surface that is covered by ice on the
  observation date. Note that these are simply visual estimates by the
  observer; no quantitative check has been run to determine the accuracy
  of the observation. No estimate is made of the thickness of the ice.
</para>
          <para>
  Data from field sheets were entered into an Excel spreadsheet and
  error-checked. The Excel spreadsheet was then converted to a CSV text
  file.
