 <abstract><para>Biodegradation was a major mechanism for removing oil resulting from the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Prince William Sound, Alaska. For three field seasons, we examined the hexadecane, phenanthrene, and naphthalene mineralization potentials of hydrocarbon-degrading microorganisms and the accompanying hydrocarbon concentrations from the intertidal and shallow subtidal sediments. We found that mineralization potentials were not directly dependent on sediment substrate concentrations, but environmental factors influenced the ability of microbial populations to mineralize polycyclic aromatic and aliphatic compounds. These factors included the intensity of physical mixing experienced, the treatments received, and the availability of alternative carbon sources. In 1989, when the Exxon Valdez oil was relatively unweathered and before shoreline treatment was begun, the mineralization potentials of aromatic hydrocarbons were high at many sites even in the presence of alkanes at higher concentrations. However, by 1990, mineralization potentials for alkanes were greater than those for aromatics at oiled sites exposed to terrestrial biowaxes or fatty acids from the bioremediation process. Therefore, our study shows that sediment chemistry data alone cannot predict the persistence of hydrocarbons following the Exxon Valdez oil spill and demonstrates the need for systematic ecosystem-level studies of the abiotic and biotic factors influencing biodegradation.

Restoration Project 95026 (continued as 97026) was initiated as part of a detailed study plan in 1994. The project was a synthesis of data collected from prior projects including: (1) NRDA Air/Water Study Number 2 Petroleum Hydrocarbon-Induced Injury to Subtidal Marine Sediment Resources (changed to Subtidal Study Number 1 in 1991). The final reports for Subtidal Study Number 1 (including NRDA Air/Water Study Number 2 data) were submitted in June 1992 (microbiology) and July 1994 (chemistry). (2) Restoration Study Number 93047 Exxon Valdez Restoration Proiect: Subtidal Monitoring. The results of this project are found in two reports, Microbiology of Subtidal Sediments: Monitoring Microbial Populations (Project 93047-2) Recovery of Sediments in the Lower Intertidal and Subtidal Environment (Project 93047-1). A journal article from the current study (Restoration Project 95026) was published in 1997: Sugai, S.F., J.E. Lindstrom and J.F. Braddock. 1997. Environmental Influences on the Microbial Degradation of Exxon Valdez Oil on the Shorelines of Prince William Sound, Alaska. Environmental Science &amp; Technology. 31:1564-1572.</para>

 <methods><methodStep><description><section><title>Sampling</title>
 <para>Shore washing was conducted from landing craft vessels equipped with large pumps providing seawater for manned hoses as well as a header hose laid at the top of the beach to provide a constant flood of water through the substrate. The oil washed from shore floated on the seawater and was held within a containment boom that workers deployed around the work zone. A skimmer or sorbent material then recovered the oil contained within the boom.</para>
 <para>Surface sediment (0-3 cm) samples were collected for microbial and hydrocarbon analyses on six cruises conducted in July 1989, November-December 1989, June 1990, July 1990, September 1990, and June 1991. Surface sediment samples were collected in the intertidal zone (referred to as shoreline or 0 ml and offshore at 3 and 6 m were collected by SCUBA divers while shoreline samples were depths at mean low tide. Samples at the 3 and 6 m depths were collected by either SCUBA divers or a shore party in the low intertidal zone as close to low tide as was feasible. The shoreline and subtidal samples were composites of eight subsamples collected at random intervals along a 30-m transect parallel to the shoreline. Only one bag of sediment was collected from each site at each depth on the July 1989 cruise while three replicate bags were collected at each depth for all subsequent cruises. All sediment samples were kept in coolers until processing for microbiological analyses (within 3 h of collection). Due to the prevalence of rocks and coarse-grained sediments at several locations and depths in Prince William Sound, we assayed samples from which all rocks greater than 1 cm in diameter were removed.</para>

 <methodStep><description><section><title>Hydrocarbon Mineralization Potential</title>
 <para>A radiorespirometric protocol was used to assay the hydrocarbon mineralization potentials of microorganisms in sediment slurries. The radiolabeled hydrocarbons, [1-14C] - hexadecane and [1,(4,5,8)-14C] - naphthalene or [9-14C]- phenanthrene were used as representatives of aliphatic and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Naphthalene was used as model polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons for the earliest cruise because 14C-labeled phenanthrene was unavailable on short notice. Because of volatility concernswith naphthalene, phenanthrene was used in addition to naphthalene in November 1989 and replaced naphthalene in subsequent cruises. Mineralization potentials measured for both substrates in November 1989 were not significantly different. Sediment was diluted (1:10) in sterile Bushnell-Haas mineral salts medium amended with 2.5% NaCl. Replicate vials of 10-mL sediment slurries were injected with 50 microliter of a 2 g/L solution of radiolabeled hydrocarbon in acetone, resulting in an initial activity of approximately 5000 dpm/mL slurry.</para>
 <para>For samples collected in July 1989, duplicate vials were prepared from each sediment (one bag per depth per site) for three incubation times (time 0, 2 d, and 10 d). For later samples, three bags of sediment were collected for each depth at each site. For each bag, seven replicate vials of each concentration of substrate were prepared consisting of one time-zero killed control and 3 vials at 2 incubation times (2 d and 8 or 10 d). All vials were incubated at about 15 degrees C and were agitated on a rotary shaker for the first 24 h. At the end of the designated incubation period, samples were &quot;killed&quot;, and the CO2 was trapped by adding 1 mL of 10 N NaOH per vial. At the end of each cruise, the vials were acidified; the 14CO2 was stripped from the samples, collected in CO2-sorbing scintillation cocktail, and counted by liquid scintillation. Final oxidation rate potential values are expressed as [micrograms mineralized per gram dry sediment per day]. Because both hexadecane and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons mineralization potentials were often greater at 2 d than at 10 d for incubations conducted in July 1989 as well as occasionally in samples collected later, indicating likely substrate limitation in the 8- and 10-d incubations, we have chosen to use only 2-d oxidation rate potentials in this study. Data from the 2-d and 8-10-d naphthalene and phenanthrene mineralization potentials conducted in November 1989 were quite variable and obscure the influence of substrate on the determination of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons oxidation rate potential. The 2-d mineralization potentials (n = 16) were 2.3 +/- 5.8 for naphthalene vs 2.5 +/- 5.1 micrograms per gram per day for phenanthrene; the 8-10-d potentials [n = 26) were 3.0 +/- 1.8 and 3.4 +/- 1.4 micrograms per gram per day, respectively.</para>

 <methodStep><description><section><title>Hydrocarbon Analyses</title>
 <para>Sediment samples were analyzed for petroleum hydrocarbons by the Geochemical and Environmental Research Group at Texas A&amp;M University and by the NOAA Auke Bay laboratory using gas chromatography/ mass spectrometry. Concentrations are reported on sediment dry weight basis. Results of the chemical analyses were screened on the basis of surrogate recoveries and minimum detection limits. Individual analytes and the summary statistics affected by them (e.g.,total polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, total normal alkanes) were excluded from the analysis if the recoveries of corresponding analyte surrogates fell outside the range 30-150%.</para>
 <para>The high sulfur content of Exxon Valdez oil helped to distinguish it from other polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon sources. The pattern of hydrocarbon concentrations in sediment samples was judged to be similar to those in Exxon Valdez oil if it met three criteria: (1) the ratio of alkyl dibenzothiophenes to alkyl phenanthrenes exceeded 0.30; (2) the ratio of alkyl chrysenes to alkyl phenanthrenes exceeded 0.10; and (3) the concentration of alkyl phenanthrenes exceeded 5.0 ng/g.</para>

 <para>Based on environmental conditions, we considered four types of stations: heavily oiled, sheltered locations (Block Island, Herring Bay, Northwest Bay, SnugHarbor); heavily oiled locations exposed to heavy wave or tidal action (Disk Island, Sleepy Bay); lightly oiled, sheltered location (Bay of Isles); and a reference site (Olsen Bay).</para>

 <methodStep><description><section><title>Shoreline Treatment</title>
 <para>Dates and types of treament conducted on specilic areas in Prince William Sound were obtained from the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation (ADEC). The primary information sources were the Daily Shoreline Assessment inspection report files. The stations used for the NOAA and UAF sediment samples were located on the ADEC Prince William Sound BeachSub-Segment Map (November18, 1991) and from the subsegment location, the daily treatments were determined. Bioremediation usually occurred after manual and mechanical work was complete. Numerous beach treatments were used to remove oil.</para>

 <methodStep><description><section><title>Most Probable Number of Hydrocarbon-Degrading Microorganisms</title>
 <para>The number of hydrocarbon-degrading microorganisms in each sediment sample was estimated using the Sheen Screen most probable number technique. Hydrocarbon-degrading microorganisms were defined as those microbes capable of dispersing a sterile Prudhoe Bay crude oil sheen layered on Bushnell-Haas mineral salts (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, MI) broth amended with 2.5% NaCl. For July 1989 samples, duplicate enumeration assays were prepared for each subtidal depth at each site. For all other samples, one enumeration assay was prepared from each replicate sediment sample at a given site and depth to yield triplicate values. The Sheen Screen plates were incubated at approximately 15 degrees C for 3 weeks before being scored for disruption of the oil sheen.</para>
