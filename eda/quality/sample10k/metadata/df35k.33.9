 <abstract><para>As part of the ongoing harlequin duck studies, we conducted experiments with captive birds at the Alaska SeaLife Center to evaluate responses to oil ingestion and plumage oiling that could lend insight into mechanisms leading from oil exposure to mortality in Prince William Sound. In our captive bird experiments we found, predictably, that oil ingestion resulted in significant cytochrome P4501A induction relative to controls. The levels of induction were very similar to levels observed in wild birds, leading us to believe that results from our experiments have strong inference for understanding potential mechanisms constraining wild populations of harlequin ducks in Prince William Sound. We found that feeding and maintenance behaviors were not strongly affected by oil ingestion.
However, plumage oiling resulted in important changes to behavior; in particular, feeding activity decreased and maintenance increased with increasing plumage oiling. We suggest that the behavior changes associated with plumage oiling would not be sustainable under natural conditions and, hence, that external exposure to residual oil would most likely have significant demographic consequences, i.e. mortality.</para>

 <methods><methodStep><description><section><title>Capture and Captive Husbandry</title>
 <para>Twenty-five adult female harlequin ducks were captured during wing molt from the northwest coast of unoiled Montague Island (60.2ON, 147.2&quot;W), Prince William Sound, Alaska in early September in each of 2 years (2000 and 2001). Flightless birds were herded with sea kayaks into a corral trap placed along the shoreline. Captured birds were sexed by plumage characteristics and cloaca1 anatomy, and age class was determined by bursa1 depth (Mather and Esler 1999).</para>
 <para>Adult female harlequin ducks captured in each year were transported by float plane to the Alaska</para>
 <para>SeaLife Center (ASLC), in Seward, Alaska (60.1°N, 149.4&quot;W), where they were held in captivity for the duration of that winter and used as subjects in the experiments described below.</para>
 <para>Captive harlequin ducks were housed in a mesh-enclosed outdoor pen exposed to local climate and photoperiod conditions. The enclosure was partitioned into three 3.7 x 3.7 m sections, each with a flowing seawater pool (2000-01: diameter 1.8 my depth 0.9 m; 2001-02: diameter 2.4 m depth 0.6 m). The captive diet consisted of ad libitum commercially obtained Atlantic silversides (Menidia menidia) presented in trays on land during winter 2000-01, and an ad libitum mixed diet of Atlantic silversides and Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) placed in pools during winter 2001-02. The changes in diet composition and presentation made in the second year of the study were intended to increase the foraging effort, which was low under the conditions of the first year of the study. Freshwater was offered in each pen in heated plastic bowls to prevent freezing, along with a mixture of sand and crushed oyster shell for grit.</para>

 <methodStep><description><section><title>Oil ingestion experiments</title>
 <para>In both years of the oil ingestion experiment, birds were given 4 weeks to acclimate to the captive environment and diet before the start of oil-dosing. After acclimation, the 21 birds that had adjusted to captivity best, based on maintenance of body mass, were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatments (control, low-dose, high-dose), each with 7 birds. The birds assigned to each treatment group were kept together in one of the 3 partitions of the outdoor enclosure. Each bird was banded with a pair of colored plastic tarsus bands to allow identification of individuals.</para>
 <para>Different dosing regimes were used in the 2 years of the oil ingestion experiment (Table 2.1 in report). In 2000, dosing was conducted twice weekly. Low-dose birds were fed 1 ml of oil per kg body mass at each dosing, high-dose birds were fed 10 ml of oil per kg body mass at each dosing, and controls were fed no oil, although they were handled identically to the dosed birds. The average body mass (fl SD) of the harlequin ducks used in the study was 523.0 f 25.8 g and was similar in both years. Doses were administered via gavage with a syringe and feeding tube; control birds were gavaged with an empty feeding tube. Dosing was done in the morning before birds had fed.</para>
 <para>We changed the dosing regime in the second year of the study to better simulate low-level, intermittent ingestion of weathered crude oil. During winter 2001 -02, dosing was conducted every other day in the evening, after birds were allowed to feed. Low-dose birds were fed 0.57 ml of oil per kg body mass, high-dose birds were fed 5.71 ml of oil per kg body mass, and control birds were handled identically, but were fed no oil. The cumulative dose over a 2-week period for each treatment was equivalent in both years of the study (low-dose 4 ml kg-', high dose 40 ml kg-'), but doses were smaller and more frequent in the second year. In both years, birds were held for 60-90 minutes after dosing in an indoor, mesh-bottomed pen before being returned to the outdoor enclosure to prevent contamination from oily excreta.</para>
 <para>We dosed birds with weathered crude oil from Prudhoe Bay, Alaska. To simulate weathering, crude oil was mixed with seawater and stirred continuously for 10 days at 25OC, after which it was separated from water and stored in air tight containers until dosing (Ben-David et al. 1999). This process was meant to remove the more volatile, acutely toxic, low molecular weight aromatic hydrocarbons, as would occur when oil is released into the environment during an oil spill (Ben-David et al. 1999). We measured doses on a weight per volume basis using an electronic balance (f 0.01 g) and the specific gravity (g m~'o)f the weathered oil. Doses were based on body masses measured at the previous handling event. Dosing occurred between 15 October 2000 and 20 February 2001 during the first year (total dosings = 37), and between 15 October 2001 and 10 February 2002 in the second year (total dosings = 60). Birds that became sick during the course of the experiment were treated by ASLC veterinary staff. If possible, oil dosing was continued through the course of treatment; however no data were collected until sick birds returned to good health as judged by the veterinary staff. If the illness was severe, the sick bird was removed from the experiment. Mortalities unrelated to oil-dosing occurred in all 3 treatments during both winters of the experiment; the sample size at the end of dosing in both winters was 17.</para>

 <methodStep><description><section><title>Behavioral observations</title>
 <para>Time-activity budgets were quantified by following a focal individual continuously and recording the duration of time spent in all activities during a 30-minute observation period (Altmann 1974). Activities were categorized as feeding, maintenance (preening, bathing, stretching, comfort movements), locomotion (walking, swimming, flying), resting (sleeping, loafing), social (agonistic interactions), or drinking. Feeding activity in winter 2000-01 when birds fed from trays consisted of handling food items, and in winter 2001 -02 when feeding required diving for food, feeding activity consisted of time spent searching, diving, and handling food items. Time spent in activities was recorded using The Observer software (Noldus Information and Technology 1991) and a notebook computer. One observer conducted all behavioral observations using binoculars from an elevated blind located 10 m from the outdoor enclosure.</para>
 <para>Birds were observed in a random sequence; no resampling occurred until all birds had been sampled in the prior round of observations. Start times were randomly determined within 3 equal diurnal periods (morning, afternoon, evening) beginning 30-minutes prior to sunrise and continuing until 30-minutes after sunset. On each sampling day, 1 bird from each treatment during each of the 3 diurnal periods was sampled, for a total of 9 observations on each sampling day. Temperature (C), estimated wind speed (Beaufort scale), and day length (minutes) were recorded at the start of each observation session.</para>
 <para>During the second year of the study, the feeding protocol was modified during the first 6 weeks of dosing, therefore only behavioral observations conducted after these modifications were complete (06 December 2001) were included in analyses. Three birds died from causes unrelated to oil-dosing between the start of dosing in winter 2001-02 and the start of behavioral observations, and therefore time-activity budget data were collected from only 18 birds during winter 2001-02.</para>

 <methodStep><description><section><title>Plumage-oiling Experiment</title>
 <para>We conducted a plumage-oiling experiment between 21 February and 18 March 2002, drawing subjects from the group of birds used in the oil ingestion experiment conducted earlier that winter. Ten days after the conclusion of the ingestion experiment, we randomly assigned birds to 3 plumage-oiling treatments such that each of the former ingestion treatments was represented in each new plumage-oiling treatment. Plumage-oiling treatments consisted of a lightly oiled group exposed to 1 ml of crude oil for 40 minutes (n = 6 birds), a moderately oiled group exposed to 2.5 ml of crude oil for 50 minutes (n = 4 birds), and a heavily oiled group exposed to 5.0 ml of oil for 60 minutes (n = 6 birds). Birds were individually exposed to weathered Prudhoe Bay crude oil in the laboratory while at rest in a tub containing 14 L of seawater. After a 10 minute acclimation period, weathered crude oil was injected through a port using a syringe. The experiment was stratified over a 3-week period. Birds from 2 treatments were oiled on day 1 of each oiling period and remained oiled for 7 days.</para>
 <para>After oil exposure, birds were housed in the outdoor enclosure previously described. Behavioral observations were conducted over each 7-day experimental period using the same protocol as described for the oil ingestion experiment. The behavior of 1 to 4 randomly selected, non-oiled birds was sampled during each observation session during the first 2 weeks of the experiment as controls; birds that had been oiled and washed during a previous week of the experiment were not included in the pool of control birds so that by the final week of the experiment no birds remained that had not been previously oiled (i.e., no control observations were conducted during the final week).</para>

 <methodStep><description><section><title>CYPlA Induction - liver biopsies</title>
 <para>Following the captive bird oil ingestion experiments in both years, we surgically obtained small (&lt; 0.1 g) liver biopsies for CYPlA analysis. Liver samples frozen in liquid nitrogen were shipped to Woods Hole for subsequent preparation and analysis. Individual liver pieces were homogenized in 7 ml final volume homogenizing buffer (0.05 M Tris, 0.15 M KC1, pH 7.4), and microsomes were sedimented by differential centrifugation as described previously (Stegeman et al., 1979). Microsomes were resuspended in approximately 2 ml per g tissue with resuspension buffer (0.05 M Tris, 0.1 rnM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 20% v/v glycerol, pH 7.4). Protein was determined in a 96 well plate using the micro- procedure of Smith et al. (1985).</para>
 <para>7-Ethoxyresorufin-0-deethylase (EROD), the catalytic function of hydrocarbon-inducible CYP</para>
 <para>1 A, was measured using a kinetic modification of the plate-based assay of Kennedy et al. (1993). EROD activity was determined in duplicate in a 48 well plate at 20' C using a CytofluorB fluorescent plate reader (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Each well contained 200 p1 consisting of lpl of microsomes (4-15 pg protein), 2 pM 7-ethoxy resorufin in 50 rnM Tris buffer, 0.1 M NaC1, pH = 7.8. Catalytic activity was initiated by the addition of NADPH in buffer to a final 1.67 rnM concentration. Fluorescence was determined at 1 min intervals over 6 min, and the linear slope (fluorescence per minute) was divided by the slope of the resorufin product standard curve (fluorescence per pmol) determined under the same conditions to yield pmol per minute per mg protein catalytic rates.</para>
 <para>We compared average (+- SE) EROD activity across oil ingestion treatments. We detected dramatic interannual differences in EROD activity for both captive and field samples. We determined that these differences were a laboratory artifact and that, while comparisons among treatments were appropriate in any given year, between year comparisons were not. Therefore, we developed an index to EROD activity, based on the assumption that EROD activity would be similar in controls in each year. We set controls in each year to 1, and adjusted other treatment estimates according to their multiplicative relationship with the reported measurements of controls. We calculated estimates of variance on original data and adjusted those using the same correction factor.</para>

 <methodStep><description><section><title>Parameters of interest - Body Mass</title>
 <para>Bodymass of birds in the oil-dosing experiment was measured at each dosing event; 2 measurements wk-1 during winter 2000-2001, 3-4 measurements wk-1 during winter 2001-2002.  In the plumage-oiling experiment, bodymass was measured prior to oiling and again at the end of the 7 day oiling period, thus 2 measurements were taken from each bird in the experiment.  Bodymass was measured using an electronic balance (± 0.1 g).</para>

 </methodStep>
 <methodStep><description><section><title>Parameters of interest - Energy Intake</title>
 <para>In each oil-exposure experiment, birds in the same treatment were fed together, thus treatment, rather than each individual bird, was the experimental unit for analysis.  In the oil-dosing experiment, during both years daily food consumption rate (i.e., total grams of food consumed by each treatment each day) was measured by weighing food placed in each pen in the morning, and then removing and weighing all food remaining in each pen in the evening.  In winter 2001-2002, daily food consumption rate was measured for each of the 2 food types.</para>
 <para>Daily food consumption rate for each treatment was scaled by the number of birds in the treatment each day.  Energy intake rate was calculated as the product of daily food consumption rate and the mean energy content of each food type.  Mean energy content was quantified for each food type using bomb calorimetery (mean kcal g-1 wet mass ± SD: Atlantic silversides 1.64 ± 0.17, n =  46; Antarctic krill 1.32 ± 0.21, n = 11).  In 2001-2002, daily energy intake rate for each of the 2 food types were summed to get one measure of energy intake rate.  Daily measurements of daily energy intake were averaged for each week of the experiment, and this weekly average was used in analysis of energy intake during the oil-dosing experiment.</para>
 <para>In the plumage-oiling experiment, daily energy intake rate was measured and calculated as described for the oil-dosing experiment.  However, measurements of daily energy intake during each of the 7 days of the oiling period were used for analysis.  Energy intake was measured from birds in oiling treatments, as well as from a group of birds (n = 10) that either had not been oiled, or birds that had been previously oiled and cleaned.  This group of non-oiled birds were housed together, and measurements of their food consumption were made on days concurrent with oiled birds, thus controlling for any potential effects of weather on energy intake rate.  Birds in the non-oiled treatment that had been previously oiled and cleaned were assumed to have energy intake rates similar to birds that had not been oiled.</para>

 </methodStep>
 <methodStep><description><section><title>Parameters of interest - Daily Energy Expenditure</title>
 <para>In each of the oil-exposure experiments, we measured daily energy expenditure (DEE) of birds with doubly labeled water (DLW; Lifson and McClintock 1966).  We determined the optimal dosage of DLW based on preliminary measurements of natural abundances of 2H and 18O, and water flux in our subjects.  Water flux was estimated by injecting 1 g of deuterium (2H2O, 99.9 AP enrichment), and drawing a 90 µl blood sample 1.5 h following injection, and then again after 24 h. DEE was determined using 0.88 g (amount determined based on water flux) of labeled water with 60 atom percent 18O and 30 atom percent 2H was injected intramuscularly for each bird.  Another 90 µl blood sample was taken after a 1.5 h equilibration period, after which birds were returned to pens and left undisturbed.  After 48 hours, birds were recaptured and a final 90 µl blood sample was taken.  All blood samples were collected in 6 heparinized microhemocrit tubes that were flame-sealed and stored at 5oC prior to analysis at the Centre for Isotope Research in Groningen, The Netherlands.</para>
 <para>During the first year of the oil-dosing experiment, 1 mid-winter measurement of DEE was taken from each bird in December 2000.  In the second year, 2 measurements were taken from each bird: the first during mid-winter on 17 January 2002, and the second during late winter on 06 February 2002.  During the plumage-oiling experiment, 1 measurement of DEE was made from each bird; DLW was administered on the day of oil exposure (day 1 of the oiling period) and the final blood sample was taken 48 h later.</para>

 <methodStep><description><section><title>Parameters of interest - Oxygen Consumption</title>
 <para>We measured O2 consumption rate ( using an open-flow respirometry system.  Birds were placed in a respiration chamber (L × W × H: 35 × 20 × 20 cm; 14.0 L) through which air was pumped at a rate of 1.8 L min -1 with a veristatic pump; a subset of air (0.1 L min -1) was routed to an O2 analyzer (Ametek S-3A/1, Applied Electrochemistry, Sunnyvale, CA) to determine changes in % O2 content in effluent air.  Air was scrubbed with drierite and ascarite to remove carbon dioxide and water prior to entering the chamber, and again with drierite prior to entering the O2 analyzer.  The O2 analyzer was calibrated to atmospheric oxygen (20.95% O2) before each respirometry run.  During a run, %O2 content of the effluent air was measured continuously over a 60 min period and was recorded each minute of the run using Datacan Software (Sable System; Las Vegas, NV) and a desktop computer.  Oxygen content of effluent air was converted to O2 consumption rate according to Withers (1977).  Oxygen consumption rate of birds placed in the chamber stabilized after the initial 20 min, therefore the last 40 min of each run was used to determine basal O2 consumption rate.  The lowest 10 min average O2 consumption rate of each respirometry run was used for analysis.</para>
 <para>For the oil-dosing experiment, O2 consumption rate was measured while birds were birds at rest, within their thermoneutral zone (mean chamber temperature during runs 21ºC), and in a post-absorptive state (i.e., basal oxygen consumption rate).  During both winters of the oil-dosing experiment, respirometry was conducted 2 times wk -1 and O2 consumption rate was measured from 1 bird from each treatment during each session.  During 2000-2001, respirometry was conducted immediately following dosing; in 2001-2002 respirometry was conducted on the day after birds were dosed.  Sequence in which birds were sampled was randomly determined.  After all birds had been sampled once, a new random sequence was determined and another round of sampling was conducted.</para>
 <para>During the plumage-oiling experiment, O2 consumption rate was measured as described for the oil-dosing experiment, however, air temperature was maintained near the lower limit of the thermoneutral zone (0-5 ºC) in a temperature controlled cabinet.  Additionally, O2 consumption rate of birds resting on seawater was measured using a respiration chamber containing water.  The wet respiration chamber (L × W × H: 37 × 28 × 26 cm; 26.9 L) contained 7 L of seawater (temperature 4-6ºC).  Air flow was maintained and O2 content of effluent air was measured as per the methods described previously.  Oxygen consumption rate of each oiled bird was measured in each of the respiration chambers 2 times during the course of the oiling period.  Oxygen consumption rate while in air was measured on days 2 and 6 of the oiling period, while O2 consumption rate while resting in water was measured on days 3 and 7.  Additionally, because O2 consumption rate of birds resting on water was not basal, measurements from 10 birds were taken prior to oil exposures as control measurements.</para>
