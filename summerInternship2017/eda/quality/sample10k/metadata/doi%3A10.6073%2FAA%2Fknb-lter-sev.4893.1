Tank/222.  The Phenological events monitored include all of the major
events observable in a plants life : germinating, vegetating, budding
(flowers), flowering, fruiting, dormant, dying, and dead.  All
transects were placed close to Sevilleta LTER meteorological stations.
The phenological information collected will give researchers baseline
data for use in plant reproductive or phenological studies.  The
proximity of sites to weather stations allows coupling of biotic and
abiotic data to ascertain cause and effect relationships of climate
and plant growth.  Monitoring these sites through time will allow
researchers to see how the timing of different events changes from
year to year and over many years.</literalLayout></para></abstract><keywordSet><keyword keywordType="place">Sevilleta, New Mexico</keyword><keyword keywordType="theme">Transect</keyword><keyword keywordType="theme">Plant</keyword><keyword keywordType="theme">germinating</keyword><keyword keywordType="theme">vegetating</keyword><keyword keywordType="theme">budding</keyword><keyword keywordType="theme">flowering</keyword><keyword keywordType="theme">fruiting</keyword><keyword keywordType="theme">dispersing</keyword><keyword keywordType="theme">senescing</keyword><keyword keywordType="theme">dead.</keyword><keyword keywordType="taxonomic">Vegetation</keyword><keyword keywordType="theme">Ecology</keyword><keyword keywordType="theme">Phenology</keyword></keywordSet><intellectualRights><section><title>DATA USE POLICY</title><para><literalLayout>Any Sevilleta LTER data set and accompanying metadata can be used for academic, research, and other professional purposes.

	  The Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge is in Socorro County in central New Mexico.  
	  The Sevilleta is almost 100,000 ha of land that has floristic influences from the
	  Chihuahuan Desert to the south, the Great Plains grassland from the east, The Great 
	  Basin Desert from the northwest, and montane vegetation as one moves up in elevation. 

	* Study Area Description
	  
	  RIO SALADO - This is a very sandy site.  The predominate grasses are Oryzopsis hymenoides, 
	  Hilaria jamesii, and Sporobolus flexuosus. The shrubs include four-wing saltbush (Atriplex
	  canescens), mesquite (Prosopis glandulosus), indigo bush (Dalea scoparia), Penstemon ambiguus 
	  and creosote bush (Larrea tridentata). The herbaceous vegetation includes Cassia bauhinioides, 
	  Thelesperma megapotamicum, and Zinnia grandiflora.

          DEEP WELL - The deep well site is west of the missile range road, between the road and the deep 
	  well meteorological station. This is a grassland site with grasses from the shortgrass prairie such
	  as blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis) and grasses with a more southern affinity such as black grama 
	  (Bouteloua eriopoda).  Other grasses found at the site include dropseeds (Sporobolus spp.) and 
	  threeawns (Aristida spp.).  Shrubs are uncommon but those that occur include Yucca glauca, Ephedra 
	  torreyi, and four-wing saltbush (Atriplex canescens). Herbaceous plants include Plantago purshii, 
	  Hymenopappus filifolius, and globe mallows (Sphaeralcea spp.).

	  GOAT DRAW - This is a pinyon/juniper site in the Los Pinos mountains.  Transect #1 runs across the rocky 
	  hillslopes and through two rocky washes.  Transect #2 runs along a gravelly stream
	  bed. Transect #1 is covered with pinyon (Pinus edulis) and juniper (Juniperus monosperma) trees and shrubs 
	  that include beargrass (Nolina microcarpa), feather dalea (Dalea formosa), shrub live oak (Quercus
	  turbinella), and brown-spined prickly pear (Opuntia phaeacantha). The grasses include hairy grama 
	  (Bouteloua hirsuta), bottlebrush squirreltail (Sitanion hystrix), and side-oats grama (Bouteloua
	  curtipendula).  The second transect has shrubs that include cane cholla (Opuntia imbricata) and four-wing saltbush (Atriplex canescens)
	  and many herbs such as Verbena wrightii, Erodium cicutarium, and Lesquerella ovalifolia.

	  WATERSHEDS - The transects in this site criss-cross a gravelly ephemeral stream bed in the foothills of 
	  the Los Pinos Mountains.  The woody vegetation in this stream bed includes Junipers
  	  (Juniperus monosperma), Brickellia californica, Apache plume (Fallugia paradoxa).  On the hills are 
	  Junipers and shrubs such as cane cholla (Opuntia imbricata), beargrass (Nolina microcarpa), and Oreganillo
	  (Aloysia wrightii). The herbs in the wash include Lesquerella ovalifolia, and Mirabilis multiflora.  The 
	  grasses found at this site include three-awn (Aristida sp.), fluff-grass Erioneuron pulchellum,
	  and  four species of grama grass (Bouteloua spp.). 

	  TRANSECT DESCRIPTION -  Three of the sites have three transects and one site has four transects.  Black Butte,
	  Deep Well, and Five Points each have three transects. The transects are 100 meters long, about 20 meters apart,
	  and have a roughly a north/south azimuth.  The transects are situated to capture the vegetation that dominates 
	  and characterizes each site.  Sepultura has four transects, each running from the shelf above the stream channel, 
	  across the channel to the other shelf. These transects are 50 meters long and situated to capture the diversity of  
	  plants in the wash, up the banks, and on the shelf.</geographicDescription><boundingCoordinates><westBoundingCoordinate>-107.089501</westBoundingCoordinate><eastBoundingCoordinate>-106.513623</eastBoundingCoordinate><northBoundingCoordinate>34.422253</northBoundingCoordinate><southBoundingCoordinate>34.185570</southBoundingCoordinate><boundingAltitudes><altitudeMinimum>1428</altitudeMinimum><altitudeMaximum>1790</altitudeMaximum><altitudeUnits>meter</altitudeUnits></boundingAltitudes></boundingCoordinates></geographicCoverage><temporalCoverage scope="document"><singleDateTime><calendarDate>1993</calendarDate></singleDateTime></temporalCoverage></coverage><purpose><para><literalLayout>See abstract above.</literalLayout></para></purpose><maintenance><description><section><para><literalLayout>*File initiated 23 Oct 1991 by Troy Maddux Data added 9 Dec 1991 by

Today is Jan. 4th 1994.  I separated all the phenology data into three 
separate files.  The first file,&quot;allstuff91-92&quot; contains data from the
very begining of the project, 4-4-91, to 5-26-92 when the sites were changed.
The second file,&quot;allstuff92&quot;, contains data for the remainder of the 1992
year.  Finally, this file,&quot;allstuff93&quot;, contains all the data for the 1993 
year.  The logs for all three files is contained within this one.  I am
Rupal Shah, and if you have any questions, come to me for answers.24 Feb 1993 - began updating the documentation to correspond to the Sevilleta
LTER data manager&apos;s guide to documentation.  Made into an rdb file and checked,
all collumns projected out and made sure the data were o.k.
10/07/98 - Added documentation section. K. Taugher
	 - Imported final version of Kartesz code data. K. Taugher
	 - Imported species code changes to dataset. K. Taugher
	 - Updated documentation section to reflect Kartesz changes 
	 - Added an additional space to &apos;species code&apos; field to allow
	 - Added information on Kartesz codes (and reference) to the SPECIES
	   section. K. Taugher
	 - Added new Kartesz SPECIES CODE LIST. K. Taugherfor longer Kartesz 
	   codes. K. Taugher
	 - Realigned data columns to right justification. K. Taugher
         - Added Kartesz code conversion details including step by step
	   details of how the conversion was done. K. Taugher
	 - Added my name and email address to documentation section under
	   Kartesz code conversion data management should any question arise.
	   K. Taugher
	 - Removed a column of &quot;2&quot;&apos;s from the dataset. These
	   were added as an artifact of the sas code conversion program used
	   for the transect datasets which  was also used to convert the plant
	   species codes in this dataset (see CODE CONVERSION in the 
	   documentation section below for a discussion of the code conversion
	   process). This column was not a part of this dataset
	   and was removed. K. Taugher
	 - Added a final line of &quot;{END OF DATA}&quot; to dataset. K. Taugher
	 - Changed the field positions in the &apos;VARIABLE DESCRIPTIONS AND 
	   DEFINITIONS&apos; section to reflect the current positions. As Kartesz
	   codes may be up to 6 characters in length, an additional field 
	   position was added to the &quot;code&quot; column which then changed all
	   the field positions that followed. K. Taugher

  	  (Juniperus monosperma), Brickellia californica, Apache plume (Fallugia paradoxa).  On the hills are 
	  Junipers and shrubs such as cane cholla (Opuntia imbricata), beargrass (Nolina microcarpa), and Oreganillo
	  (Aloysia wrightii). The herbs in the wash include Lesquerella ovalifolia, and Mirabilis multiflora.  The 
	  grasses found at this site include three-awn (Aristida sp.), fluff-grass Erioneuron pulchellum,
	  and  four species of grama grass (Bouteloua spp.). 

	  TRANSECT DESCRIPTION -  Three of the sites have three transects and one site has four transects.  Black Butte,
	  Deep Well, and Five Points each have three transects. The transects are 100 meters long, about 20 meters apart,
	  and have a roughly a north/south azimuth.  The transects are situated to capture the vegetation that dominates 
	  and characterizes each site.  Sepultura has four transects, each running from the shelf above the stream channel, 
	  across the channel to the other shelf. These transects are 50 meters long and situated to capture the diversity of  
	  plants in the wash, up the banks, and on the shelf.</geographicDescription><boundingCoordinates><westBoundingCoordinate>-107.0959</westBoundingCoordinate><eastBoundingCoordinate>-106.4982</eastBoundingCoordinate><northBoundingCoordinate>34.4407</northBoundingCoordinate><southBoundingCoordinate>34.1669</southBoundingCoordinate><boundingAltitudes><altitudeMinimum>1600</altitudeMinimum><altitudeMaximum>1500</altitudeMaximum><altitudeUnits>meter</altitudeUnits></boundingAltitudes></boundingCoordinates></geographicCoverage><temporalCoverage scope="document"><singleDateTime><calendarDate>1993</calendarDate></singleDateTime></temporalCoverage></coverage><method><methodStep><description><para><literalLayout>* Analytical Procedures:</literalLayout></para></description></methodStep><sampling><studyExtent><description><para><literalLayout>The phenological data were collected by looking at the plants contained
