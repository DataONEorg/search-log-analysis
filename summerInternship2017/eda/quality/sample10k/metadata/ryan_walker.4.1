 <methods><methodStep><description><section><title>Avain Point Count</title>
 <para>Avian point counts were conducted at each point three times between mid-May and early July in 2013 and 2014. Point counts were made between sunrise and four hours post-sunrise.  Every individual of every bird observed was recorded by type of detection (visual vs. aural) during 1-minute intervals. Birds observed outside of sample unit during the count (e.g., a bird calling from far outside the treatment unit during a count at a sample point within the treatment) were recorded but these data were not included in any subsequent analysis. Point counts were not conducted during rainy or windy weather.</para>

 <sampling><studyExtent><description><para>Our study encompassed piñon-juniper woodlands of the Arkansas River valley between Salida and Cañon City, Colorado (Fig. 1), within lands managed by the Bureau of Land Management Royal Gorge Field Office (BLM RGFO).  Elevation across the study area ranges from 1,600 m to over 3,900 m; the elevation of Salida is 2,160 m and the elevation of Cañon City is 1,615 m.  Piñon-juniper woodlands occupy upland sites at elevations &lt; ca. 2,500 m. Though geographically narrow, the BLM RGFO study area represents a climate gradient: cooler and drier in the west and warmer and wetter in the east. Mean annual temperatures in Salida is 7.7oC; this increases to 12.2oC in Cañon City.  Mean annual precipitation increases from 27.6 cm in Salida to 32.1 cm in Cañon City (WRCC 2012).  Piñon-juniper woodlands are dominated by two-needle piñon (Pinus edulis), intermixed with Rocky Mountain juniper (Juniperus scopulorum) at higher elevations in the cooler and drier western portions of the study area, and oneseed juniper (J. monosperma) in the lower, warmer, and wetter east.  The BLM RGFO has conducted over 300 fuels reduction treatments on nearly 17,000 acres in between 1998 and the initiation of our study in 2012 (Matt Rustand, Wildlife Biologist, BLM RGFO, personal communication). The two most commonly employed techniques, and the focus of our study, are mastication and hand thinning followed by lop-and-scatter or pile-and-burn.</para>

 <samplingDescription><para>Within our study area, we identified 29 different treatment units, each paired with an adjacent, untreated control unit, for field measurements of birds, vegetation, and fuels.  Unit selection criteria included correct vegetation type (PJ woodlands), adequate area for four sample points separated by &gt;200 m, and accessibility. The treatments we examined were implemented between 2003 and 2014. Most treatments were masticated (25); four were subject to hand-thinning. Within each unit, we installed at random four sample points separated by &gt; 200 m, for a total of 232 sample points.</para>
