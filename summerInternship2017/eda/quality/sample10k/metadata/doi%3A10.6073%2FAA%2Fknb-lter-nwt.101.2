Poles were driven into the snowpack to form transects in several  snow-accumulation areas (Arikaree Glacier, Green Lakes 4 and 5, and the  Martinelli basin). The height difference (cm) between the snow surface and  the top of each pole was recorded. On the subsequent visit the new height  difference was recorded and the pole was driven into the snow and the reset  height was recorded. Poles in a given transect were relocated as necessary  during the course of the season.</para></abstract><keywordSet><keyword>NWT</keyword><keyword>Niwot Ridge LTER Site</keyword><keyword>LTER</keyword><keyword>Colorado</keyword><keyword>ablation rate</keyword><keyword>meltout</keyword><keyword>snow</keyword><keyword>snowdepth</keyword></keywordSet><distribution scope="document"><online><url function="download">http://culter.colorado.edu/exec/.extracttoolA?ablatraw.nc</url></online></distribution><coverage scope="document"><temporalCoverage scope="document"><rangeOfDates><beginDate><calendarDate>1993-05-13</calendarDate></beginDate><endDate><calendarDate>2005-10-06</calendarDate></endDate></rangeOfDates></temporalCoverage><geographicCoverage scope="document"><geographicDescription></geographicDescription><boundingCoordinates><westBoundingCoordinate>-105.643</westBoundingCoordinate><eastBoundingCoordinate>-105.3753</eastBoundingCoordinate><northBoundingCoordinate>40.0615</northBoundingCoordinate><southBoundingCoordinate>39.9932</southBoundingCoordinate></boundingCoordinates></geographicCoverage></coverage><maintenance><description><para>The documentation section of this file was created by Susan Kindig and Rick Ingersoll in late August of 1993.[RCI 27 August 1993] Additional comments from Nel Caine were incorporated into the documentation section, data from 13 May through 26 August 1993 were added to the data section, and the file was put under sccs control on 30 August 1993.

Consequently, all of the 1994 data (through 7 July) were deleted and the re-entered and new 1994 data (through 18 August 1994 were appended to the data section on 12 September 1994.
