      <abstract>
This part of DS 781 presents data for the bathymetric contours for several seafloor maps of the Offshore Pigeon Point map area, California. The vector data file is included in "Contours_OffshorePigeonPoint.zip", which is accessible from http://dx.doi.org/10.5066/F7513W80
10-m interval contours of the Offshore Pigeon Point map area, California, were generated from bathymetry data collected by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and by California State University, Monterey Bay (CSUMB). Mapping was completed between 2006 and 2009 using a combination of a 244-kHz Reson 8101 multibeam echosounder and a 234-kHz SEA SWATHplus bathymetric sidescan-sonar system. The mapping missions collected bathymetry data from about the 10-m isobath to beyond the 3-nautical-mile limit of California’s State Waters.
Bathymetric contours at 10-m intervals were generated from a modified 2-m bathymetric surface. The original surface was smoothed using the Focal Mean tool in ArcGIS and a circular neighborhood with a radius of 20 to 30 meters (depending on the area). The contours were generated from this smoothed surface using the ArcGIS Spatial Analyst Contour tool. The most continuous contour segments were preserved while smaller segments and isolated island polygons were excluded from the final output. The contours were then clipped to the boundary of the map area.</abstract>
      <purpose>These data are intended for science researchers, students, policy makers, and the general public. These data can be used with geographic information systems or other software to identify bathymetric features. These data are not intended to be used for navigation.</purpose>

        <procdesc>During the mapping missions, an Applanix position and motion compensation system (POS/MV) was used to accurately position the vessel during data collection, and it also accounted for vessel motion such as heave, pitch, and roll (position accuracy, +/-2 m; pitch, roll, and heading accuracy, +/-0.02 degrees; heave accuracy, +/-5 percent, or 5 cm) KGPS altitude data (Fugro Pelagos, StarFix HP &amp; XP units; CSUMB, NavCom 2050) were used to account for tide cycle fluctuations and sound velocity profiles were collected with an Applied Microsystems SVPlus sound velocimeter. Soundings were corrected for vessel motion using the Applanix POS/MV data, for variations in water-column sound velocity using the AM SVPlus data, and for variations in water height (tides) using vertical-position data from the KGPS receivers. Final XYZ soundings and bathymetric-surface models were referenced to the World Geodetic System of 1984 (WGS 1984) relative to the North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD 1988). Bathymetric contours at 10-m intervals were generated from the merged 2-m bathymetric surface. The most continuous contour segments were preserved while smaller segments and isolated island polygons were excluded from the final output. Contours were smoothed via a polynomial approximation with exponential kernel (PAEK) algorithm using a tolerance value of 60 m. The contours were then clipped to the boundary of the map area.</procdesc>

      <procstep>
        <procdesc>During the USGS mapping mission, GPS data with real-time-kinematic corrections were combined with measurements of vessel motion (heave, pitch, and roll) in a CodaOctopus F180 attitude-and-position system to produce a high-precision vessel-attitude packet. This packet was transmitted to the acquisition software in real time and combined with instantaneous sound velocity measurements at the transducer head before each ping. The returned samples were projected to the seafloor using a ray-tracing algorithm that works with previously measured sound-velocity profiles. Statistical filters were applied to discriminate seafloor returns (soundings) from unintended targets in the water column. Finally, the soundings were converted into 2-m-resolution bathymetric-surface-model grids.
Bathymetric contours at 10-m intervals were generated from a modified 2-m bathymetric surface. The original surface was smoothed using the Focal Mean tool in ArcGIS and a circular neighborhood with a radius of 20 to 30 meters (depending on the area). The contours were generated from this smoothed surface using the ArcGIS Spatial Analyst Contour tool. The most continuous contour segments were preserved while smaller segments and isolated island polygons were excluded from the final output. The contours were then clipped to the boundary of the map area.</procdesc>

    <techpreq>The downloadable data file has been compressed with the "zip" command and can be unzipped with Winzip (or other tool) on Windows systems. To utilize these data, the user must have software capable of uncompressing the WinZip file and importing and viewing an Esri ArcMap TIFF. Users should download the ArcGIS Project File, OffshorePigeonPointGIS.mxd.zip, a compressed (with the "zip" command) version of the ArcMap document (.mxd) that has all the data layers loaded in the table of contents for "Offshore Pigeon Point" and has all the data symbolized as on the data release map sheets. Download and save this ArcGIS project file, including all data layers, to the directory the user has created for this GIS.</techpreq>
