    in-ice thermistor string: temperatures at different positions above, through and below the ice
    above-ice temperature/humidity sensor: air temperature and humidity
    above-ice down-looking acoustic transducers: the position of the upper snow or ice surface
    below-ice upward-looking acoustic transducer: the position of the ice bottom
    below-ice down-looking acoustic transducer: local sea level at the Mass Balance Site
    below-ice thermistor: water temperature 

Ice thickness is calculated from the distance between the upper and lower surfaces of the ice
In winter the positions of the upper and lower surfaces allow us to determine snow accumulation and ice growth, respectively
In spring and summer, our measurements show the thinning that takes place from above and below.

Measurements are performed every 15 minutes and transferred to a base station in Barrow through a 900 MHz UHF radio link, from where they are sent through an internet connection to Fairbanks for further processing.

A detailed description of the set-up is available at: http://seaice.alaska.edu/gi/observatories/barrow_sealevel/brw2012/BRW12_MBS_metadata.txt

Please read the metadata before using data from the Mass Balance Site. Note that data format and metadata file may change during the season without notice. 

The Barrow MBS was deployed on landfast sea ice in the Chukchi Sea at Barrow, Alaska on January 11, 2012. At the time, ice thickness was 0.97 m (38 in) and snow depth was 0.05 m (2 inches).
Ice thickness, snow depth, sea level, and temperature profiles are recorded every 15 minutes, transferred to Fairbanks, processed and presented online with approximately 5 minutes delay.
The probe will be recovered from the ice prior to break-up. Recovery is likely to take place in June 2012.</dcterms:abstract><dcterms:accessRights/><dcterms:spatial xsi:type="dcterms:Box">northlimit=71.387786865231; southlimit=71.360321044919; eastlimit=-156.50299072263; westlimit=-156.54144287106</dcterms:spatial><dcterms:temporal>Begin 2013-01-01T00:00:00; End 2013-12-31T05:00:00</dcterms:temporal></dcTerms></metadata>
