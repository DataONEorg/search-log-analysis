# search-log-analysis
This repo started to support a 2017 summer internship evaluating DataONE search
and event logs and exploring potential relationships between metadata quality
and discoverability. With the conclusion of the summer internship, files
produced during that time have been moved into the folder
'summerInternship2017', and the focus of work has shifted to developing log
monitoring and analysis tools that interoperate with the DataONE system
to support ongoing log analysis.
