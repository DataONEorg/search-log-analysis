      <abstract>This arc and point data set contains streamflow-measurement sites and
reaches indicating streamflow gain or loss under base-flow conditions
along the Republican River and tributaries in Nebraska during October
20 to 21, 1980 (U.S. Geological Survey, 1982).  The streamflow measurements
were made to obtain data on ground-water/surface-water interaction.
Flow was observed visually to be zero, was measured, or was estimated
at 118 sites.  The measurements were made on the main stem of the Republican
River and all flowing tributaries that enter the Republican River between
Harlan County Reservoir and the Republican River near Hardy, Nebraska gaging
station in part of the Republican River Basin, Nebraska.  Tributaries were
followed upstream until the first road crossing where zero flow was encountered.
For selected streams, points of zero flow upstream of the first zero flow site
also were checked.

Streamflow gain or loss for each stream reach was calculated by
subtracting the streamflow values measured at the upstream end of
the reach and values for contributing tributaries from the
downstream value.  The data obtained reflected base-flow conditions
suitable for estimating streamflow gains and losses for
stream reaches between sites.

This digital data set was created by manually splitting the lines
from a 1:250,000 hydrography data set (Soenksen and others, 1999) at
every streamflow-measurement site.  Each set of stream segments between
measurement sites was assigned a unique reach number.
			</abstract>
      <purpose>This data set was created to archive the calculated streamflow gains and losses
of selected streams in part of the Republican River Basin, Nebraska,
in October 1980, and make the data available for use with geographic information
systems (GIS).
			</purpose>
      <supplinf>This digital data set was created by manually plotting locations of
streamflow measurements.  These points were used to designate
steam-reach segments to calculate gain/loss per river mile.

Reach segments were created by manually splitting the lines from a
1:250,000 hydrography data set (Soenksen and others, 1999) at every
location where the streams were measured.  Each stream-reach segment
between streamflow measurement sites was assigned a unique reach number.
All other lines in the hydrography data set without reach numbers were
omitted.

    <useconst>The locations of stream-measurement points were digitized
from 1:126,720-scale county road maps.  The corresponding stream
reaches were derived from a 1:250,000 hydrography coverage (Soenksen
and others, 1999).  If measurement sites are used separately from
reaches, the maximum scale of 1:100,000 should not be exceeded.
When used in conjunction with the reach segments, the maximum scale
should not exceed 1:250,000.

AREA - Area of feature in meters; 0 for point feature.

PERIMETER - Perimeter of feature in meters; 0 for point feature.

OCT80# - Internal sequence number (i.e. the record number) of the
arc in the ARC file.

OCT80-ID - User-assigned feature ID.

SITEID - Stream measurement identification (ID) number.  Unique positive
integer to designate stream measurement site at downstream end of reach.
SITEID is not in downstream order.

FLOW1080 - Streamflow measured at site in cubic feet per second.

REACHID - Unique ID of stream segment between UPSITEID and SITEID; REACHID
is SITEID of stream measurement site at downstream end of reach.  REACHID is
-9999 when there is no upstream site.

UPSITEID - Unique ID of measurement site at upstream end of reach; UPSITEID
is -9999 when there is no site upstream.

FLOW_ERR - Uncertainty in flow measurement.  The value is in units of cubic
feet per second indicating uncertainty in the streamflow measurement (5% of
measured streamflow); FLOW_ERR is -9999 when no flow is measured.

NOTES - Text describing location of streamflow measurement and other
additional information.

LAT - Latitude of site in geographic coordinate system in DMS format.

LON - Longitude of site in geographic coordinate system in DMS format.

GAGE - Streamflow-gaging station ID where streamflow measurement
was made at a gaging station.  Record is blank if the measurement site
was not a gaging station.

COUNTY - Name of county in which streamflow measurement was made.

FNODE# - Internal number of from-node.

TNODE# - Internal number of to-node.

LPOLY# - Internal number of the left polygon.

RPOLY# - Internal number of the right polygon.

LENGTH - Length of arc in meters.

OCT80# - Internal sequence number (i.e. the record number) of the
arc in the ARC file.

OCT80-ID - User-assigned feature ID.

REACHID - Unique ID of stream segment between UPSITEID and SITEID; REACHID
is SITEID of stream measurement site at downstream end of reach.  REACHID is
-9999 when there is no upstream site.

GAINLOSS - Difference in streamflow measured at downstream site (SITEID)
and upstream site (UPSITEID) plus tributary inflows.  Positive or negative
number in cubic feet per second where value is positive in gaining reach
and negative in losing reach; GAINLOSS is -9999 when there is no flow at both
sites or no upstream site.

GL_SIG - Text indicating whether calculated streamflow gain/loss is greater
than uncertainty (FLOW_ERR) in streamflow measurement.  If the absolute value
of gain/loss is greater than uncertainty, gain/loss is considered to represent
a real change in streamflow and GL_SIG is 'yes'.  If the absolute value of
gain/loss is less than or equal to uncertainty, the gain/loss could reflect
measurement uncertainty and GL_SIG is 'no'.

MILES - Length of stream reach between SITEID and UPSITEID in miles determined
from OCT80SEGS coverage; R_LENGTH is -9999 when no site upstream.

GL_MILES - GAINLOSS per river mile with units of cubic feet per second per river
mile.  Positive or negative number where value is positive in gaining reach and
negative in losing reach; GL_MILE is -9999 when there is no flow at both sites or
no upstream reach.

SIG_TYPE - Text describing the interpreted significance of gain/loss for each reach
segment.
