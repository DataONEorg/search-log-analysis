 <abstract> <para>Net primary productivity (NPP) of agricultural regions, where most of the land is sown with a few well-studied crops, was estimated from crop harvested yield, as recorded in national agricultural statistics. The magnitudes and inter-annual variations in NPP of croplands in the US Mid-West were estimated using crop area and yield data from the US National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS). Total NPP, including estimates of both above and below-ground components, was calculated from harvested yield data by (1) conversion from reporting units of yield of the crop product, usually in volume, to mass; (2) conversion from fresh weight to dry weight; (3) estimation of above-ground yield using crop harvest indices, defined as the ratio of economic product (e.g. grain) dry weight to plant above-ground dry weight; and (4) estimation of below-ground yield as a function of above-ground biomass. This approach was applied to corn, soybean, sorghum, sunflower, oats, barley, wheat and hay in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, North Dakota, Ohio and Wisconsin for 1992, and in Iowa from 1982 to 1996. Many counties in these eight states had over 70 per cent coverage of these crops. In Iowa, corn and soybean accounted for over 50 per cent of the land area in most counties. County-level NPP in 1992 ranged from 4 Mg/ha/yr (400 g/m2/yr, dry biomass, or 200 gC/m2/yr in terms of carbon content) in North Dakota, Wisconsin and Minnesota, to over 17 Mg/ha/yr (1700 g/m2/yr, dry biomass, or 850 gC/m2/yr) in central Iowa, Illinois and Ohio. Areas of highest NPP were dominated by corn and soybean cultivation. NPP for counties in Iowa varied between years by a factor of 2, with the lowest NPP in 1983 which had an unusually wet Spring, in 1988 which was a drought year, and in 1993 which experienced floods. A sensitivity analysis, conducted by varying harvest index and root:shoot ratio by 10-50 per cent, indicated that the limit of accuracy of the method is about 1 Mg/ha/yr (100 g/m2/yr, dry biomass).</para>

 <para>Crop NPP in the U.S. Midwest states 1992 and State of Iowa (1982-96) used harvested yield statistics provided by the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS, Prince et al. 2000).  The counties selected for the Midwest states had 50 percent or more land in agriculture and less than 20 percent forest (These thresholds were not applied for temporal analysis in Iowa).  The overall approach included i) calculating cropland grain yield based on the NASS data; ii) converting the grain yield to NPP; and iii) estimating the remaining biological yield estimates using harvest indices and shoot:root biomass ration to estimate belowground allocation.  County-level data were aggregated to 0.5 degree cell size.  NPP values of grid cells crossing county boundaries were calculated with an area weighting method.  For Midwest states NPP, only cells completely within the boundary of the study area were included in this report.</para>

 <abstract> <para>The NCEAS Project&quot;Development of a Consistent Worldwide Net Primary Production (NPP) Database&quot; consisted of meetings of three working groups conducted from December 1997 to October 1998. The purpose of these meetings was to develop methodologies for extrapolating sparse field observations of net primary production, including environmental controls on carbon allocation, and to create data sets representative of major worldwide vegetation and environmental regimes. The methodologies were then used to produce consistent data sets of worldwide NPP estimates, which were previously not available. The data sets were intended to be used by global change researchers to (1) parameterize and validate global primary production models, (2) calibrate models driven by remotely sensed data, and (3) re-examine worldwide patterns of NPP. The data sets include key ecological data such as biomass dynamics, climate and soils information, and NPP, providing avaluable global resource for a variety of other ecological studies such as biodiversity and nutrient cycling.</para>
