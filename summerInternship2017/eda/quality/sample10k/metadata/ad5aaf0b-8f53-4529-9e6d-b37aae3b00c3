      <abstract>Apalachicola Bay and St. George Sound contain the largest oyster fishery in Florida, and the growth and distribution of the numerous oyster reefs here are the combined product of modern estuarine conditions and the late Holocene evolution of the bay. A suite of geophysical data and cores were collected during a cooperative study by the U.S. Geological Survey, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Coastal Services Center, and the Apalachicola National Estuarine Research Reserve to refine the geology of the bay floor as well as the bay's Holocene stratigraphy. Sidescan-sonar imagery, bathymetry, high-resolution seismic profiles, and cores show that oyster reefs occupy the crests of sandy shoals that range from 1 to 7 kilometers in length, while most of the remainder of the bay floor is covered by mud. The sandy shoals are the surficial expression of broader sand deposits associated with deltas that advanced southward into the bay between 6,400 and 4,400 years before present. The seismic and core data indicate that the extent of oyster reefs was greatest between 2,400 and 1,200 years before present and has decreased since then due to the continued input of mud to the bay by the Apalachicola River. The association of oyster reefs with the middle to late Holocene sandy delta deposits indicates that the present distribution of oyster beds is controlled in part by the geologic evolution of the estuary. For more information on the surveys involved in this project, see http://woodshole.er.usgs.gov/operations/ia/public_ds_info.php?fa=2005-001-FA and http://woodshole.er.usgs.gov/operations/ia/public_ds_info.php?fa=2006-001-FA.</abstract>
      <purpose>This point shapefile contains the interpretation of the sea floor surface based on seismic-reflection profiles collected in 2006 in Apalachicola Bay. Added to the shapefile are the swath bathymetry values (when available) at each seismic shot point location. This point shapefile will be used to verify the gridding method and cellsize for a known surface (sea floor) to be used with the subsurface interpretations based solely on the seismic-reflection data.</purpose>

        <horizpar>The R/V Rafael acquired data recording navigation using a Real Time Kinematic (RTK) GPS at a one second interval. The GPS antenna was mounted over the bathymetric sonar. The seismic pole mount system was on the starboard side and approximately 1.5 meters aft of the bathymetry system. No offset was added to the navigation for the seismic data. For seismic data collected with the IRIS system, an RTK GPS system was also used. The GPS antenna for IRIS was mounted directly over the seismic transducer. This system can provide positions to within 0.1 meters. However, due to some errors with the acquisition software, this accuracy is reduced. The accuracy is approximately 2 m given the constraints of the acquisition system.</horizpar>

        <srccontr>The seismic data used for the interpretation comes from two different seismic systems. The bulk of the data are from the EdgeTech FSSB 424 system pole mounted on the R/V Rafael. These data were logged in SEG-Y format using SBLogger. This system had a 1/4 second fire rate. The remainder of the data, in the shallower areas, were acquired with the USGS IRIS system. IRIS is a remotely operated vehicle that has an EdgeTech FSSB 424 chirp sub-bottom profiling system mounted to it. The seismic data were recorded by JSTAR, a software package developed by EdgeTech. This system had a much faster fire rate, almost 15 times per second. The EdgeTech FSSB 424 is a chirp sub-bottom profiler that operates within a 4-24kHz frequency range. The IRIS vehicle is navigated using Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) GPS. The antenna is mounted directly on the platform to minimize navigational error. The R/V Rafael was also navigated with an RTK GPS system with the navigation antenna approximately 1.5 meters forward of the seismic transducer. This offset was not accounted for.
The swath bathymetry data were collected aboard the R/V Rafael with an SEA Submetrix 2000 interferometric sonar operating at a frequency of 234 kHz. The motion (heave, pitch roll and yaw) was measured with a TSS DMS 2-05 attitude sensor mounted directly above the Submetrix transducers. More information on the swath bathymetry system can be found in USGS Open-File Report 2006-1381.</srccontr>

        <procdesc>Two different seismic systems acquired data in Apalachicola Bay in 2006. One system was the EdgeTech FSSB 424 (4-24kHz) aboard the R/V Rafael. These data were acquired as SEG-Y files using SBLogger. The second seismic system was also an EdgeTech FSSB 424 chirp system mounted on the USGS autonomous vehicle IRIS. These data were acquired with JSTAR in JSF format and converted to SEG-Y format using a C-program written by Tom O'Brien (USGS, Woods Hole). These SEG-Y files were then converted from IEEE format to IBM floating point using SIOSEIS, and the shots were renumbered starting at one. With initial preparation work on the seismic data complete, these data and navigation needed to be loaded into Landmark SeisWorks software for interpretation. In order to load the seismic data and navigation into Landmark SeisWorks software the navigation needed to be extracted from the header of the seismic data.  An AWK script was used to extract the navigation from the seismic data headers and export in UTM, Zone 16 eastings and northings, rounded to the nearest meter.</procdesc>

        <procdesc>Once the navigation is extracted from the seismic data, this navigation has to be loaded into the interpretation software - Landmark SeisWorks version R2003. The navigation is loaded using Data - Management - Seismic Data Manager. A new survey is created for each acquisition system (06001 for the Rafael data, asv06 for the IRIS data). Then, Data - Import - Seismic Data Loader and point to the navigation text file. When loading the navigation, use a decimation of 0, use first shot point if duplicates are found, and overwrite data in target project if necessary. A decimation of zero was used because the IRIS navigation had already been decimated to take every 5th record from the complete navigation extracted from the headers of the IRIS seismics. The Rafael data did not need decimation. The Rafael data had a 1/4 second fire rate while the IRIS data fired at approximately 15 shots per second. Once the navigation is loaded and verified, then the actual seismic data can be loaded. To do this, use PostStack Data Loader. There was a small issue in working with seismic data in SeisWorks where it's better to have all the seismic profiles at the same sample rate. It's a display issue in the interpretation phase where opening a profile in a window with a different sample rate than the previously loaded profile doesn't always refresh the window properly. The result is an incorrect interpretation - the interpreted line falls in the wrong spot vertically. The seismic data were resampled to the same sample rate to eliminate this problem. The Rafael acquired data at two different sample rates: 40 microseconds and 80 microseconds. The Rafael seismics were all resampled to 40 microseconds in the PostStack data loader. Additionally, the lines had an automatic 8-bit scaling applied to each profile when loaded. The IRIS seismic lines were acquired with two sample rates - 23 microseconds and 46 microseconds. All of the lines were resampled to a 40 microsecond sampling interval in PostStack data loader and had an automatic 8-bit scaling applied to each profile when loaded. With the seismic data now loaded, the project has to be modified so these changes are reflected in the surveys and the data can be interpreted. This process step and all subsequent process steps were overseen by the same person - VeeAnn A. Cross.</procdesc>

        <procdesc>Any points falling outside Apalachicola Bay were deleted.  Five new attributes were added to the shapefile: ms_meters, spd_of_snd, swth_dep, dep2grd, and include. Based on the swath data collected simultaneously with the seismic data, the speed of sound in water value for the very shallow IRIS work was 1476 meters per second. The speed of sound in the deeper water associated with the R/V Rafael collected data was measured at approximately 1510 meters per second. However, for the purposes of these data, a value of 1700 meters per second is used. The increased speed is necessary to have the seismic data agree with the swath bathymetry data in areas of overlap and close proximity. This higher value accounts for seismic transducer depth that was not accounted for at acquisition and processing time. All lines with the line designation starting with "asv", indicating the IRIS system, used field calculator to populate the spd_of_snd attribute with 1476. The remaining records populated the spd_of_snd with 1700. Field calculator was then used on the ms_meters attribute to calculate the depth in meters based on the ms attribute (two-way travel time) and the spd_of_snd attribute. Using VACExtras v2.02, swath bathymetry values from published (USGS Open-File Report 2006-1381) 2-m data were extracted at each seismic navigation point and placed in the attribute swath_dep. Where no 2-m bathymetry exists, the swath_dep attribute was assigned a value of -9999.   All records from the swath_dep attribute that did not equal -9999 were copied to the attribute dep2grd using the field calculator.  The remaining dep2grd records were assigned the value in the ms_meters attribute. And finally, the test attribute will be used to omit any points that coincide with a manmade feature. To do this, any points falling within 75 meters of a man-made feature had the value -9999 assigned to the include attribute (-9999 is a common NODATA value).  This was accomplished by using the Selection tool - Select by Location.  Features were selected in the seafloor point shapefile that intersected the ApalachicolaBaseMap polygon shapefile with a buffer applied to the polygon of 75 meters. The ApalachicolaBaseMap polygon is available from USGS Open-File Report 2006-1381.  A value of -9999 was also assigned to the include attribute for all cross-lines. All remaining values were left at zero.</procdesc>

Other minor edits were probably performed (title, publisher, publication place, etc.). The source information was incomplete and had to be modified to meet the standard. The distribution format name was modified in an attempt to be more consistent with other metadata files of the same data format. The metadata date (but not the metadata creator) was edited to reflect the date of these changes. The metadata available from a harvester may supersede metadata bundled within a download file. Compare the metadata dates to determine which metadata file is most recent.</procdesc>
