      <abstract>

This digital dataset describes classes of land-surface form in
the conterminous United States.  The source of the data is the
map of land-surface form in the 1970 National Atlas of the
United States, pages 62-63, which was adapted from Edwin
H. Hammond, "Classes of land surface form in the forty-eight
states, U.S.A," Annals of the Assoc. of Am. Geographers, v.54,
no. 1, 1964, map supp. no. 1, 1:5,000,000.
</abstract>
      <purpose>

The intended use of this dataset was for the national
environmental framework for the U.S. Geological Survey National
Water-Quality Assessment Program (NAWQA), but NAWQA decided to
use another approach (hydrologic landscape regions) instead of
this dataset.
</purpose>
      <supplinf>

The printed map classifies land-surface form according to five
properties: 1) percentage of area occupied by surfaces of
gentle inclination (slope); 2) local relief; 3) percentage of gently
inclined surface that lies in the lower half of the local relief
(profile type); 4) percentage of area occupied by sand, ice and
standing water; and 5) pattern of major crests peaks, and
escarpments.  The digital version shows only the first three
(1-3) of the five properties.

The coverage contains one polygon attribute, CLASS (class of
land-surface form).  The CLASS codes are:

Plains:

A1 =       Flat plains;
A2 =       Smooth plains;
B1 =       Irregular plains, slight relief;
B2 =       Irregular plains.

Tablelands:

B3c,d =    Tablelands, moderate relief;
B4c,d =    Tablelands, considerable relief;
B5c,d =    Tablelands, high relief;
B6c,d =    Tablelands, very high relief.

Plains with hills or mountains:

A,B3a,b =  Plains with hills;
B4a,b   =  Plains with high hills;
B5a,b   =  Plains with low mountains;
B6a,b   =  Plains with high mountains.

Open hills and mountains:

C2 =       Open low hills;
C3 =       Open hills;
C4 =       Open high hills;
C5 =       Open low mountains;
C6 =       Open high mountains.

Hills and mountains:

D3  =      Hills;
D4  =      High hills;
D5  =      Low mountains;
D6  =      High mountains.

The scheme of classification is:

SLOPE (Capital letter):

A = More than 80% of area gently sloping;
B = 50-80% of area gently sloping;
C = 20-50% of area gently sloping;
D = Less than 20% of area gently sloping.

LOCAL RELIEF (Numeral):

1 =  0-100 feet;
2 = 100-300 feet;
3 = 300-500 feet;
4 = 500-1000 feet;
5 = 1000-3000 feet;
6 = Over 3000 feet.

PROFILE TYPE (lower case letter):

a = More than 75% of gentle slope is in lowland;
b = 50-75% of gentle slope is in lowland;
c = 50-75% of gentle slope is on upland;
d = More than 75% of gentle slope is on upland.

The National Water-Quality Assessment (NAWQA) Program of the
U.S. Geological Survey funded the scanning of the original map.

Steve Kambly of the USGS Mapping Applications Center scanned the
mylar overlays and provided NAWQA with raster and vector files.

Jim Whitmer arranged for the film positive composites of the
linework.

Kerie Hitt, NAWQA, cleaned up the preliminary scanned coverage
and prepared the final coverage and metadata.

This dataset includes three (slope, local relief, and profile
type) of the five properties of land-surface form delineated on
the original map by Hammond.  The dataset does not include the
property describing the percentage of area occupied by sand and
standing water or the property describing the pattern of major
crests, peaks or cones, and escarpments and valley sides.  The
dataset does not include the water bodies depicted in the
original map either.

Obtain photo composite of linework to be
scanned.

The original source material was a mylar separate of landform
boundaries and latitude/longitude tics provided by James
Whitmer of the U.S. Geological Survey in Reston, Virginia.
The contact lines for the landform boundaries were
discontinous where they intersect with water bodies.  We
elected not to scan the water bodies separate for the map,
because the resulting boundaries would not match water bodies
in any standard digital series.

Scan the linework.

Steve Kambly, Mapping Applications Center, scanned the mylar
separate and created a raster file (.tiff) and vector file
(ARC INFO export format), as follows:

1) Scan mylar source on Ektron Drum Scanner at 1000 dpi.

2) Review scan to make sure line quality will allow for
vectorization.

3) Send scan file to an Intergraph edit station where it is
loaded into MicroStation, which is a graphics editing
software package.

4) Vectorize raster file using IVEC software that runs within
MicroStation.

5) Export resulting design file as a DXF file.

6) Read DXF file into ARC/INFO using DXFARC command.

7) Provide ARC export file to Kerie Hitt, who did the rest of
the processing.

Register the coverage.

1) Make a point coverage out of the nodes in US1.

NODEPOINT US1 US1_NODES

2) From the points, select some known locations (lat/long
tics on the printed map) to be converted to tics.  Write
the XY digitizer coordinates for each tic point to a file
called temptics.

3) Generate a blank coverage containing the tics.

GENERATE BLNKTIC
INPUT temptics
TICS

4) Delete the existing tics in the coverage US1 and replace
them with the tics in the BLNKTIC coverage.  Save as
coverage US2 with 22 tics.

5) Prepare a list of GEOGRAPHIC coordinates to match the
tics in US2, then project the list to ALBERS.

6) Generate a blank coverage called USREAL using the ALBERS
tics.

GENERATE USREAL
INPUT albtics
TICS

7)  Transform the coverage with the linework to the desired Albers
coordinate system.

Clean up linework.

1) Delete the lat/long lines, legend boxes, and so forth.

2) Close the gaps between the landform boundaries occupied by
water bodies on the source map by extending the landform
boundaries across the gaps.

3) Produce check plot of linework and verify the lines against
the original mylar.

There is a polygon attribute table associated with this dataset.

CLASS is the code for land surface form.  Each code consists
of 3 characters, such as "B2b."  The capital letter designates
the SLOPE, the number indicates the LOCAL RELIEF, and the
lower case letter shows the PROFILE TYPE:

SLOPE:
A = More than 80% of area gently sloping
B = 50-80% of area gently sloping
C = 20-50% of area gently sloping
D = Less than 20% of area gently sloping

LOCAL RELIEF:
1 = 0-100 feet
2 = 100-300 feet
3 = 300-500 feet
4 = 500-1000 feet
5 = 1000-3000 feet
6 = Over 3000 feet

PROFILE TYPE:
a = More than 75% of gentle slope is in lowland
b = 50-75% of gentle slope is in lowland
c = 50-75% of gentle slope is on upland
d = More than 75% of gentle slope is on upland

The class codes and descriptions are listed under Supplemental
Information.

SYMBOL is a working variable set for plotting certain color symbols.
