      <abstract>
In freshwater bodies of New Hampshire, the most problematic aquatic invasive plant species is Myriophyllum heterophyllum or variable leaf water-milfoil. Once established, variable leaf water-milfoil forms dense beds that can alter the limnologic characteristics of a waterbody, impacting natural lacustrine communities and their habitats.  Variable leaf water-milfoil infestations also disrupt recreational uses of waterbodies and have negatively affected swimming, boating, fishing, and property values in and around several lakes and ponds in New Hampshire.

In 1965, Moultonborough Bay, Lake Winnipesaukee became the first waterbody in New Hampshire where variable leaf water-milfoil was observed. Variable leaf water-milfoil is native to the Southeastern and Midwestern areas of the United States where more alkaline waters appear to limit the growth of this plant. Outside its native range, however, it adapts well to the relatively acidic, low-alkalinity, and nutrient-poor conditions of oligotrophic lakes and bays similar to Moultonborough Bay.

In 2005, the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services (NHDES) collaborated with the U.S. Geological Survey to investigate the distribution (presence and density) of variable leaf water-milfoil in Moultonborough Bay. This study utilized geophysical systems and conventional water-quality measurements to identify lake-floor environments that may provide suitable habitat for the establishment and growth of variable leaf water-milfoil. The results of the study are intended to assist resource managers in federal and state agencies by providing methods for detecting variable leaf water-milfoil and for identifying areas susceptible to infestation. Ultimately, this information may lead to early detection, prevention, and more effective mitigation strategies.

      <purpose>JPEG images of each seismic profile were generated in order to incorporate images of the seismic data into Geographic Information System (GIS) projects and data archives utilizing HTML. These JPEG images represent 37 km of chirp seismic data collected in 2005 during USGS field activity 2005-004-FA. This format is universal and yields an easily viewable image of the seismic profiles. Corresponding trackline navigation is contained within a polyline shapefile (2005-004-FA_chirptrk.shp), shot-point locations are available in a point shapefiles (2005-004-FA_chirpsht.shp).</purpose>

Navigation was acquired with Wide Area Augmentation System ( WAAS), which is accurate to + or - 1 to 2 meters, horizontally. Navigation data were acquired with a LGBX Pro receiver and sent to Triton-Elics Delph seismic acquisition software, where Chirp sub-bottom data were recorded in Society of Exploration Geophysicists Y (SEG-Y) format (Barry and others, 1975) with DGPS logged to the SEG-Y trace headers.

The Edgetech SB-424 chirp subbottom profiler was towed near the surface, close to the R/V Rafael. The instrument was secured in this position throughout the survey. Due to this tow configuration, any layback minimal. The overall horizontal accuracy, given even a small (~ 1 meter) offset between the WAAS antenna and the tow-body, is + or - 5 meters.

Chirp subbottom data were acquired with an Edgetech SB-424 chirp subbottom profiler.  The SB-424 was deployed off the port side of the USGS R/V Rafael and towed close to the lake surface.  Approximately 37 km of chirp subbottom data were collected.

Data were recorded at a 75-millisecond (ms) record length (1875 samples, 40 microsecond sample interval) and a 4-24 kHz sweep and were logged using Triton-Elics Delph seismic acquisition software (version 2005) in Society of Exploration Geophysicists Y (SEG-Y) format (Barry and others, 1975) with WAAS navigation logged to the SEG-Y file trace headers. Navigation in the SEGY header was stored as seconds of arc. The raw chirp SEGY contained 3 channels: raw, match-filtered, envelope detected.  The envelope detected channel was used for data processing.

A C-shell script was executed using Sioseis (v. 2011.2.7) to read the raw  SEG-Y file and write out a new SEG-Y file with the shots renumbered starting at 1.  A second  C-shell script was executed using Seismic Unix (version 4.1) to read the renumbered SEG-Y files, write a Seismic Unix format file (*.su), and extract SEG-Y trace header information, which included shot number, source x (arc seconds), source y  (arc seconds), year,  Julian Day,  hour, minute, second (UTC). Geographic coordinates (stored in arc seconds WGS84) were converted to eastings and northings,  UTM, Zone 19N, meters using proj (v. 4.7.1). Before saving the header information to a text file, the data were filtered using AWK (no version) to save only unique shot point locations. The unique shot navigation for each seismic line were then concatenated into a comma delimited (.csv) text file. The header records for the first several shots contained no navigation information, therefore the 'first' shot of the line is considered the first shot with usable data stored in the header.  This was generally within the first 10 shots for the majority of lines.

        <procdesc>A C-Shell script using Seismic Unix (version 4.1) to read the SEG-Y files and plot the data as 8-bit gray scale Postscript files using the Seismic Unix 'psimage' algorithm was then executed. All images were created with a horizontal scale of 40 traces per inch. The profiles contain 50 milliseconds of Two-Way Travel Time within an 8-inch vertical window, yielding 6.25 milliseconds per inch. Postscript images were converted to JPEG format using the UNIX ImageMagick (version 5.5.6). The y-axis units are two-way travel time in seconds. The units of the x-axis of the images are shot numbers. The small tick marks represent 10 shot intervals, with the larger tick marks and labels at a 100 shot interval. The x-axis label indicates the USGS cruise ID and the number of shots in the seismic record.</procdesc>
