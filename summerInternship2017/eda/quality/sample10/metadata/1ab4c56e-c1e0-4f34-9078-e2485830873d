      <abstract>An Innerspace 456 single-beam echosounder in conjunction with a Trimble® differential Global Positioning System (DGPS), HYPACK® navigation software, and Ashtech Z-Xtreme and Trimble® R8 Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receivers was used to survey 7 chutes and 3 backwaters on the Missouri River yearly from 2011-13. These chutes and backwaters are located on the Missouri River between Newcastle, Nebraska and Rulo, Nebraska in the States of Nebraska, Iowa, and Missouri.  Surveys of chutes consisted of topographic and bathymetric data collected along transects spaced 30.48 m apart from high bank to high bank.  Surveys of backwaters consisted of topographic and bathymetric data collected along a transect grid of 76.2 m spacing. The data were collected by the U.S. Geological Survey in cooperation with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Omaha District as part of the Missouri River Habitat Assessment and Monitoring Program.</abstract>
      <purpose>The purpose of this survey was to provide annual measurements of the chutes and backwaters for the USACE to calculate annual geomorphic change to understand chute and backwater evolution. This dataset is also used by the USACE for measuring the amount of shallow water habitat available for endangered species to comply with the "2000 Biological Opinion" and "2003 Amendment to the Biological Opinion" on the Missouri River as part of the their Habitat Assessment and Monitoring Program.</purpose>

    <complete>Surveys were completed along transects spaced at 30.48 or  76.2 m.  Occasionally areas of transects were not able to be surveyed if depth and substrate were not adequate or weather did not permit.</complete>
    <posacc>
      <horizpa>
        <horizpar>Horizontal accuracy is dependent on the accuracy of the GPS-surveyed position. There were two GPS/GNSS surveying methods used for this data collection effort.  The first method, for horizontal position of the hydrographic sounding data, is DGPS. The stated horizontal accuracy for the DGPS is less than one meter assuming there are greater than 5 satellites, a Position Dilution Of Precision (PDOP) of less than 4, Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) of greater than 6, elevation mask greater than 7.5, and a differential correction equivalent to a Trimble® 4000RSi.  The second method, GPS/GNSS Real Time Kinematic (RTK) surveying, was used to survey the banks and shallow water areas.  GPS/GNSS RTK surveying used either an Ashtech Z-Xtreme receiver and Geodetic IV revision "A" antenna or a Trimble® R8 antenna. RTK surveys were completed using USGS established benchmarks utilizing the NGS Online Positioning Users Service (OPUS).  The peak-to-peak error estimates in the latitudinal and longitudinal directions calculated by OPUS ranged from 0.006 to 0.020 m and 0.001 to 0.034 m respectively.  GPS accuracy is not only determined by the base station accuracy, but also by the accuracy of the rover unit.  Only data with a "fixed&#8221; position (where the exact number of radio wavelengths between the satellites and the base station antenna were calculated -- a process known as ambiguity resolution --  to yield a whole number, or integer) were used for topographic surveys.  The receiver accuracy is 1 centimeter + 2 ppm (based on the distance the rover is from the base)for RTK points with five satellites and PDOP less than 4.</horizpar>

      <vertacc>
        <vertaccr>Vertical accuracy is dependent on the accuracy of the GPS-surveyed elevation and the accuracy of the depth estimation.  The GPS survey is based off USGS established benchmarks utilizing the NGS OPUS.  The benchmarks processed through OPUS with peak-to-peak error estimates in the ellipsoid ranging from 0.012 to 0.035 m and in the orthometric ranging from 0.022 to 0.059 m.  GPS elevation accuracy is not only determined by the base station accuracy, but also by the accuracy of the rover unit.  The rover unit used during terrestrial and bathymetric surveying was either an Ashtech Z-Xtreme receiver and Geodetic IV revision "A" antennae or a Trimble® R8 antenna.  Only data coded as a "fixed" position by the GPS/GNSS receivers are used to determine water-surface elevations and topographic elevations.   The accuracy of the receivers is 2 centimeters + 2 ppm (based on the distance the rover is from the base)with 5 satellites and a PDOP of less than 4.  Depth was determined by using an Innerspace 456 single-beam echosounder.  Echosounder depth estimates can be affected by the motion of the boat most generally pitch and roll.  Depth was collected in a manner that minimized these factors by not allowing movement around the boat during data collection and by not collecting data during times of high wind/rough water.  The stated accuracy for the echosounder is +/- 0.15 meters.</vertaccr>

        <procdesc>Surveys were collected during the summer of 2011-13.  Surveys consisted of GNSS topographic surveys utilizing either an Ashtech Z-Xtreme receiver and Geodetic IV revision "A" antennae or a Trimble® R8 antenna.  The survey extent included high bank to edge of water and some in channel locations where depth permitted.  Bathymetric data were collected using an Innerspace 456 echosounder with an 8° beam and HYPACK® navigation software in conjunction with a Trimble® Ag 132 DGPS.</procdesc>
