      <purpose>This data set was created as part of the Black Hills Hydrology
Study (BHHS). The BHHS is a long-term investigation that was
initiated in 1990 as a cooperative effort between the
U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the South Dakota Department of
Environment and Natural Resources (DENR), and the West Dakota
Water Development District. West Dakota represents various
local and county cooperators. The purpose of the study is to
assess the quantity, quality, and distribution of surface and
ground water in the Black Hills area of western South Dakota
(Driscoll, 1992). The study area includes parts of Butte,
Custer, Fall River, Lawrence, Meade, and Pennington counties
in South Dakota.

      <supplinf>Reviews_Applied_to_Data:
This electronic report was subjected to the same review
standard that applies to all U.S. Geological Survey
reports. Reviewers were asked to check the topological
consistency, tolerances, attribute frequencies and statistics,
projection, and geographic extent. The reviewers checked the
metadata and a_readme.1st files for completeness and accuracy.
Related_Spatial_and_Tabular_Data_Sets:
Potentiometric contours for the Deadwood, Madison,
Minnelusa, Minnekahta, and Inyan Kara aquifers (ddwdpcon,
mdsnpcon, mnlspcon, mnktpcon, inkrpcon) and data set of
wells with water-level information for each aquifer
(ddwdpwpt, mnlspwpt, mnktpwpt, inkrpwpt). Digital data set
of spring locations in the Black Hills area (spngppt). Also,
surficial hydrogeology in the Black Hills study area

All of these items were retrieved from the USGS Ground Water
Site Inventory data base, except for AREA, PERIMETER, &lt;COV&gt;#,
&lt;COV)-ID, HEAD, MEAN_HEAD, SOW. These items were created by
staff of the BHHS.
------------------------------------------------------------

AREA: Area of the point (assigned zero).

PERIMETER: Perimeter of the point (assigned zero).

MDSNPWPT#: An ARC/INFO generated internal feature identity
number.

MDSNPWPT-ID: User-assigned feature identity number.

SITEID: This is a unique number given to each well. SITEID is
a combination of the latitude and longitude of the well, plus
a sequence number for wells located at the same latitude and
longitude. (Note: The latitudes or longitudes originally
assigned to sites in GWSI occasionally are determined to be
incorrect. In these cases, the latitude or longitude is
corrected, but the station identification number generally
remains unchanged. Thus, the latitude or longitude for an
occasional site may not correspond exactly with the station
identification number).

WELL: This is a number based on the Federal land-survey
system for western South Dakota. WELL consists of the
township number followed by "N" or "S" (north or south of the
Black Hills Baseline), the range number followed by "E" or "W"
(east or west of the Black Hills Meridian), and the section
number, followed by a maximum of four uppercase letters that
indicate, respectively, the 160-, 40-, 10-, and 2.5-acre tract
in which the site is located. These letters are assigned in a
counterclockwise direction beginning with the letter "A" for
the northeast quarter. A serial number following the last
letter is used to distinguish between wells located in the
same 2.5-acre tract.

HEAD: The head value in each well. Head is equal to the
altitude of land surface minus the water level.

MEAN_HEAD: The arithmetic mean of multiple head values
for the same well. Multiple head measurements exist when
multiple water-level measurements were taken.

AQUIFER_CODE: Unique code identifying the principal
hydrogeologic unit the well is open to.

LAT_LONG_ACCUR: The accuracy of the measured latitude
and longitude. The accuracy ranges from one second (S) to
one-minute (M). If the information is unknown, the attribute
is left blank.  These can be summarized as follows:

&gt;                                  LAT_LONG_ACCUR
&gt;
&gt;                - One second            S
&gt;                - Five seconds          F
&gt;                - Ten seconds           T
&gt;                - One minute            M

ALT_ACCUR: Altitude accuracy; values range from less than one
foot to several hundred feet.

LOG_TYPE: The type of log available for the well. If no logs
were available, the attribute is left blank.  The
different types possible are:

&gt;                                   LOG_TYPE
&gt;
&gt;                - Drillers log          D
&gt;                - Electrical log        E
&gt;                - Fluid Cond.           F
&gt;                - Geologists log        G
&gt;                - Magnetic log          H
&gt;                - Induction log         I
&gt;                - Gamma Ray log         J
&gt;                - Dipmeter survey       K
&gt;                - Laterlog              L
&gt;                - Microlog              M

SOW: This item defines the state observation wells. State
observation wells have a value of one; other wells have a
value of zero.
