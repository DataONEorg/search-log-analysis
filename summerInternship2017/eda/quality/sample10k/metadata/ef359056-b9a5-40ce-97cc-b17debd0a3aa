      <abstract>In July of 2006, the U.S. Geological Survey conducted a geophysical survey offshore of Cheniere Caminada, Louisiana. This report serves as an archive of unprocessed digital Chirp seismic reflection data, trackline maps, navigation files, GIS information, Field Activity Collection System (FACS) logs, observer's logbook, and formal FGDC metadata. Gained digital images of the seismic profiles are also provided.

The archived trace data are in standard Society of Exploration Geophysicists (SEG) SEG-Y format (Barry and others, 1975) and may be downloaded and processed with commercial or public domain software such as Seismic Unix (SU). Example SU processing scripts and USGS software for viewing the SEG-Y files (Zihlman, 1992) are also provided.

For more information on the seismic surveys see http://walrus.wr.usgs.gov/infobank/g/g306la/html/g-3-06-la.meta.html

These data are also available via GeoMapApp (http://www.geomapapp.org/) and Virtual Ocean ( http://www.virtualocean.org/) earth science exploration and visualization applications.</abstract>
      <purpose>The data archived here were collected as part of the USGS Barrier Island Coastal Monitoring (BICM) project, which is part of a broader study focused on Subsidence and Coastal Change (SCC).</purpose>
      <supplinf>The USGS Florida Integrated Science Center (FISC) - St. Petersburg assigns a unique identifier to each cruise or field activity. For example, 06SCC03 tells us the data were collected in 2006 for the Subsidence and Coastal Change (SCC) study and the data were collected during the third field activity for that project in that calendar year. Refer to http://walrus.wr.usgs.gov/infobank/programs/html/definition/activity.html for a detailed description of the method used to assign the cruise ID. The naming convention used for each seismic line is as follows: yye##a, where yy is the last two digits of the year in which the data were collected, e is a 1-letter abbreviation for the equipment type (for example, c for Chirp, ## is a 2-digit number representing a specific track, and a is a letter representing the section of a line if recording was prematurely terminated or rerun for quality or acquisition problems.  The Chirp system uses a signal of continuously varying frequency. The towfish is a sound source and receiver, which is typically towed 2 - 5 m above the seafloor. The acoustic energy is reflected at density boundaries (such as the seafloor or sediment layers beneath the seafloor), detected by a receiver, and recorded by a PC-based seismic acquisition system. This process is repeated at timed intervals (for example, 0.125 s) and recorded for specific intervals of time (for example, 50 ms). In this way, a two-dimensional vertical image of the shallow geologic structure beneath the ship track is produced.  The seismic source employed for Chirp data collection consisted of an EdgeTech SB-424 towfish running Triton Imaging SB Logger (FSSB) V. 1.6.421 acquisition software and towed about 17 m behind the GPS antenna. The frequency range was 4 - 24 kHz. Sample frequency of the data was 25 kHz, and record length was approximately 50 ms. Shot spacing was about 0.386 - 0.514 m.  For each recorded shot of the Chirp data, 3 channels of trace data are collected. Channel 2 is the "real," or in-phase component of the signal, channel 1 is the "imaginary," or quadrature component of the signal, and channel 0 is the "envelope," or product of channels 1 and 2. Only channel 0 was used to produce the profiles presented here. However, all channels are included in the SEG-Y data files.  The printable profiles provided here are GIF images that were gained using Seismic Unix software. The processed SEG-Y data were exported to Chesapeake Technology, Inc. (CTI) SonarWeb software to produce interactive versions of the profiles that allow the user to obtain a geographic location and depth from the profile for a cursor position. This information is displayed in the status bar of the browser. NOTE: The only supported Web browsers that properly display all features of the interactive profiles are Internet Explorer 6 for Windows and Firefox 1.5 for all platforms. For all browsers, the status bar and JavaScript must be enabled. Firefox also requires "Change status bar text" to be checked under Advanced JavaScript Options. Use of other browsers may result in spurious or no information given in the status window. Firefox may be downloaded at http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox. Postprocessing of the data also revealed the first shot value to be something other than 1. The year and date were also omitted from the SEG-Y headers. A conversion program called Fixping V. 1.0.0 was used to correct these three errors. These corrected SEG-Y files are provided in this archive. The unprocessed seismic data are stored in SEG-Y, 4-byte integer format, which is a standard digital format that can be read and manipulated by most seismic processing software packages (Barry and others, 1975). The SEG-Y formatted trace files have a .SEG extension. Also provided are example Seismic Unix scripts that allow the user to strip off navigation fixes from the SEG-Y headers, along with a fix for every 1,000 shots and produce a gained GIF image of each profile.</supplinf>

    <attracc>
      <attraccr>The validity or accuracy of marine seismic reflection profiles is highly qualitative and depends on equipment and operating condition variables.</attraccr>
    </attracc>
    <logic>This data set is from one cruise with consistent instrument calibrations.</logic>
    <complete>These data are collected along tracklines (2-D) and are therefore inherently incomplete. Geologic details between lines must be inferred.</complete>
    <posacc>
      <horizpa>
        <horizpar>As the seismic reflection data were acquired, the position of the vessel was continuously determined by a Coda Octopus F190 receiver, which is accurate to within 20 cm. Positions were recorded and written to the trace headers in latitude and longitude coordinates about every 1 s. The ASCII navigation files and trackline maps have not been corrected to reflect the approximately 17-m offset between the Chirp and GPS antenna. Refer to figure 1 included with this archive (Data Series 311) for a diagram of the acquisition geometry, including the GPS offset measurements. Line navigation maps and interactive profiles generated with CTI SonarWeb software have been corrected for the GPS offset.</horizpar>
      </horizpa>
      <vertacc>
        <vertaccr>These data are not to be used for bathymetry. Depths shown on the Chirp profiles are relative to the depth of the towfish, not to sea level. Furthermore, the raising or lowering of the towfish during a survey (to avoid obstacles or follow relief) produces a relative shift in the multiple reflections seen in the profile, which may be confused as a geologic feature. Any elevation change of the towfish is recorded in the logbooks and is evident on the seismic profiles by steep, abrupt shifts in the seafloor return.</vertaccr>

        <procdesc>SEG-Y header processing: All lines were first processed with FixPing V. 1.0.0 software to fix incorrect dates and initial shotpoints recorded to the shot headers during data collection. These corrected SEG-Y files are included in this archive.</procdesc>

      <procstep>
        <procdesc>Chirp processing: The original trace files for lines 06c02, 06c04, and 06c22 were divided into two or more trace files each (for example, 06c02 became 06c02_a and 06c02_b) because the original total number of traces exceeded the maximum allowed by the processing software. The SEG-Y data were processed with Seismic Unix to produce GIF images of the seismic profiles included in this report. A representative Chirp data processing sequence consisted of (1) stripping off channel 0 for each shot and converting to SU format, (2) applying automatic gain control, (3) displaying PostScript, and (4) converting of PostScript image to a GIF image. The processed SEG-Y data were then exported to CTI SonarWeb software to produce an interactive version of each profile that allows the user to obtain a geographic location and depth from the profile for a cursor position. Refer to the Supplemental Information section above for details on how to use the interactive profiles.</procdesc>

        <procdesc>Navigation processing: Shotpoint navigation files and 1,000-shot-interval location files were extracted from the trace headers of each line using Seismic Unix software. These files were then processed with PROJ.4 software (http://www.remotesensing.org/proj) to generate UTM coordinates from latitude and longitude coordinates and reformatted for use with Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI) GIS software.</procdesc>

        <procdesc>Trackline map creation: The trackline maps provided in this archive were created using the Points to Lines ArcScript (D. Rathert, http://arcscripts.esri.com/details.asp?dbid=12702) along with ESRI ArcGIS 9.1 software and then exported to Adobe Illustrator for further editing. The maps were later converted into JPEG format by Adobe GoLive. The maps are unprojected (geographic coordinates, NAD83). The coastline layer is a Louisiana Oil Spill Coordinator's Office (LOSCO) data set. The USGS is the originator of all other layers used. A map of trackline navigation for each seismic profile was also produced with CTI SonarWeb software.</procdesc>
