      <abstract>This part of DS 781 presents data for the bathymetry and shaded-relief maps of the Offshore of Point Reyes map area, California. Raster data file is included in "Bathymetry_PointReyes.zip," which is accessible from http://pubs.usgs.gov/ds/781/PointReyes/data_catalog_PointReyes.html. The bathymetry and shaded-relief maps of the Offshore of Point Reyes Map Area, California, were generated from bathymetry data collected by California State University, Monterey Bay (CSUMB), and by Fugro Pelagos. Mapping was completed between 2007 and 2010, using a combination of 200-kHz and 400-kHz Reson 7125, and 244-kHz Reson 8101 multibeam echosounders, as well as 468-kHz SEA SWATHPlus interferometric system. These mapping missions combined to collect bathymetry from about the 10-m isobath to beyond the 3-nautical-mile limit of California's State Waters. NOTE: the horizontal datum of the bathymetry data (NAD83) differs from the horizontal datum of other layers in this DS (WGS84). These data are not intended for navigational purposes.</abstract>
      <purpose>
To expand geologic mapping to the seafloor within the California's State
Waters, to update coastal geologic mapping, and to contribute to a
uniform regional geologic database, which can be used geographic information systems.
Additionally, to provide a geologic map for the public and geoscience community to aid in
assessments and mitigation of geologic hazards in the Point Reyes coastal region
and to provide sufficient geologic information for land-use and land-management decisions both onshore and offshore. This information is not intended for navigational purposes.

        <procdesc>During the Fugro Pelagos and CSUMB mapping missions, an Applanix Position and Motion Compensation System for Marine Vessels (POS/MV, 320, v4) was used to accurately position the vessels during data collection, and it also accounted for vessel's motion such as heave, pitch, and roll (position accuracy, +/-2 m; pitch, roll, and heading accuracy, +/-0.02 degrees; heave accuracy, +/-5%, or 5 cm). KGPS altitude data (Fugro Pelagos, StarFix HP &amp; XP units; CSUMB, NavCom 2050) were used to account for tide cycle fluctuations and sound velocity profiles were collected with an Applied Microsystems SVPlus sound velocimeter. Soundings were corrected for vessel motion using the Applanix POS/MV data, for variations in water-column sound velocity using the AM SVPlus data, and for variations in water height (tides) using vertical-position data from the KGPS receivers.</procdesc>
