      <abstract>
     A natural consequence of groundwater withdrawals is the removal of water from subsurface storage, but the overall rates and magnitude of groundwater depletion in the United States are not well characterized. This study evaluates long-term cumulative depletion volumes in 40 separate aquifers or areas and one land use category in the United States, bringing together information from the literature and from new analyses. Depletion is directly calculated using calibrated groundwater models, analytical approaches, or volumetric budget analyses for multiple aquifer systems. Estimated groundwater depletion in the United States during 1900–2008 totals approximately 1,000 cubic kilometers (km3). Furthermore, the rate of groundwater depletion has increased markedly since about 1950, with maximum rates occurring during the most recent period (2000–2008) when the depletion rate averaged almost 25 km3 per year (compared to 9.2 km3 per year averaged over the 1900–2008 timeframe).

      <purpose>
     The purpose of these data assessments are to estimate the cumulative long-term change in the volume of groundwater stored in the subsurface. It is not intended to capture changes related to seasonal variations and (or) short-term climatic fluctuations. The purposes of this report are (1) to document the magnitude and trends in long-term groundwater depletion in the United States, and (2) to provide additional background information and details that support the methods and calculations used to estimate groundwater depletion for the 40 areas and 1 land use category of depletion in the United States—information that underlies the assessments in Konikow (2011). Because no substantial volumetric groundwater depletion is evident in Alaska.</purpose>
      <supplinf>
      One or more methods were applied to specific aquifer systems, subareas, or categories to estimate the net long-term depletion in each system. These methods (numbered for cross referencing in Table 1 in Scientific Investigations Report 2013–5079, Groundwater Depletion in the United States (1900–2008) online at http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/sir20135079 ) included below:
		  
1. Water-level change and storativity: Integrate measurements of changes in groundwater levels over time and area, combined with estimates of storativity (specific yield for unconfined aquifers or storage coefficient for confined systems), to estimate the change in the volume of water stored in the pore spaces of the aquifer (for example, McGuire and others, 2003).
			
2. Gravity: Estimate large-scale water loss from gravity changes over time as measured by GRACE satellite data (for example, Famiglietti and others, 2011).
			
3. Flow model: Use calculations of changes in volume of stored water made using a deterministic groundwater-flow model calibrated to long-term observations of heads and parameter estimates for the system (for example, Faunt and others, 2009b).
			
4. Confining unit: Apply the method of Konikow and Neuzil (2007), which requires estimates of specific storage and thickness of the confining unit, as well as head changes in the adjacent aquifer, to estimate the depletion from confining units. For confined aquifer systems, leakage out of adjacent low-permeability confining units may be the principal source of water and the largest element of depletion (Konikow and Neuzil, 2007).
			
5. Water budget: Use pumpage data in conjunction with a water budget analysis for an aquifer system to estimate depletion (for example, Kjelstrom, 1995). This approach is limited to systems for which there are reasonable estimates of other fluxes in and out of the system; the approach is applied most often in arid to semiarid areas where natural recharge is small or negligible.
			
6. Pumpage fraction: Use pumpage data in conjunction with an assumption that the fraction of pumpage derived from storage can be correlated with the fraction during a control period or for a control area (for example, Anderson and others, 1992).
			
7. Extrapolation: In cases where data do not extend through 2008, extrapolate rates of depletion through the end of the study period using the observed rates calculated for the most recent multi-year period. Adjust rates for extrapolation accordingly if recent observed water-level changes do not support a linear extrapolation. In cases where sufficient data exist, the annual rate of depletion is estimated through correlation with the observed rates of water-level change and (or) annual rates of pumpage.
			
8. Subsidence: Calculate a volume of subsidence in areas where land subsidence is caused by groundwater withdrawals; the depletion volume must equal or exceed the subsidence volume, so this serves as a cross-check and constraint on calculated depletion volumes (Kasmarek and Strom, 2002; Kasmarek and Robinson, 2004).
			
The first three methods above (water-level change, gravity, and modeling) are the most reliable, and estimated storage changes are probably accurate to within ±20 percent in most cases. Famiglietti and others (2011) reported that the estimated changes in groundwater storage using GRACE satellite data for a 7-year period were within ±19 percent of the estimated value. The water balance computed by a well-calibrated simulation model typically has an error of less than 0.1 percent. However, this reflects numerical accuracy and precision, and not the overall reliability of the model or accuracy of computed water budget elements, which are more difficult to assess (Hill and Tiedeman, 2007). The confining unit and water budget methods are less reliable, but probably yield values within ±30 percent (see Kjelstrom, 1995; Konikow and Neuzil, 2007). The pumping fraction method is a coarser estimation method, based on assumed correlations with withdrawals that are only reliable to ±25 percent; because of additional uncertainty in related factors, this estimate is probably only reliable within ±40 percent. The accuracy of the extrapolation method decreases with extrapolation time, but in most cases is probably accurate to within ±30 percent. The subsidence method can estimate subsidence volume within ±20 percent or less, but is only used to provide a minimum bound on the estimate of total groundwater depletion.
			
Where possible, cross-checks were done between alternative approaches. For example, in the large depletion area of the Central Valley, California, the time period for depletion estimates made using a calibrated transient model (Faunt and others, 2009b) overlapped with the GRACE gravity-based estimates (Famiglietti and others, 2011) for a few years; the values computed using the two methods varied from their mean value by only ±16 percent. In the Gulf Coastal Plain near Houston, Texas, the volume of land subsidence was estimated using geographic information system (GIS) tools to analyze a map of historical subsidence (1906–2000) available from the Harris-Galveston Subsidence District (http://www.hgsubsidence.org/about/subsidence/land-surface-subsidence.html). The calculated cumulative subsidence volume was 10.5 km3. The cumulative water budget from a simulation model calibrated for 1891–2000 indicates that a total volume of 10.8 km3 of groundwater was removed from storage in the unconsolidated clay units as the clays compacted and subsidence progressed—essentially all of it during the 20th century (Kasmarek and Robinson, 2004). The difference of less than 3 percent provides good support for the quality of the model calibration and its reliability.
			
Relevant data to apply these methods are widely available in the United States. In this analysis, comprehensive assessments of groundwater depletion during the 20th century were completed for most of the highly developed aquifer systems in the United States, and descriptions of 41 separate aquifer systems, subareas, and categories are described below. In addition, several large aquifer systems were assessed and found to have negligible long-term volumetric depletion, even though there may have been other signs of overdevelopment (for example, the Edwards-Trinity aquifer system in Texas and the Floridan aquifer system in central and southern Florida). In other areas (for example, the Roswell Basin, New Mexico), groundwater depletion is known to exist, but sufficient data to provide a reasonably accurate estimate of the magnitude and temporal history of the depletion are not readily available.
			
In coastal aquifers, fresh groundwater typically occurs in a wedge or lens overlying salty groundwater. Groundwater withdrawals in such areas usually cause both a decline in the water table and a rise in the position of the underlying interface between fresh and salty groundwater. Both contribute to a depletion of fresh groundwater. As an interface rises, the freshwater is replaced with saltwater, and the net volumetric change of water in storage associated with a rising base of a freshwater lens is negligible. Because the goal of this assessment was to assess changes in the total volume of groundwater in storage—not just in the volume of usable fresh groundwater—storage changes related to the position of a subsurface freshwater-saltwater interface are not evaluated. Because of a paucity of data, assessments were not made of increased groundwater storage due to seepage losses from reservoirs, decreased storage caused by mineral extraction activities (such as dewatering, but which eventually is mostly recoverable), or depletion from numerous low-capacity domestic wells outside of the explicitly assessed areas. In areas explicitly evaluated, these factors would inherently be counted. These factors should be evaluated more carefully in the future.

        <procdesc>The compliation of existing aquifer boundaries in the United States (excluding Alaska) were referenced with index numbers and joined to predicted groundwater depletion values from 1900 through 2008. The cumulative annual depletion was estimated for each of the 108 years of the study period for the 40 assessed aquifer systems or subareas. These annual statistices, along with tables and spreadsheets are provided in the download.
				The field “aquif_id” is used to merge statistical data from Excel spreadsheets.
