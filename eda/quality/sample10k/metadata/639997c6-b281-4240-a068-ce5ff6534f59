            <abstract>Separate data for floodplain elevation and bathymetry were collected on the Upper Mississippi River System (UMRS) by the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Upper Mississippi River Restoration (UMRR) Program. While many information needs can be met by using these data separately, in many cases seamless elevation data across the river and its floodplain are needed. This seamless elevation surface was generated by merging lidar (i.e., floodplain elevation) and bathymetry data. Merging the data required special processing in the areas of transition between the two sources of data.</abstract>
            <purpose>A seamless elevation dataset provides the opportunity for a variety of modeling efforts that traverse the aquatic/non-aquatic transition areas. Examples of such modeling include physical models that route river flow at various discharges, and biological models that predict species occurrence for species that utilize the transitional areas (e.g., emergent vegetation). The merging of the bathymetry and lidar also assured the best interpolation in near-shore aquatic areas that often lacked bathymetry data due to shallow conditions during surveys.</purpose>
            <supplinf>Separate metadata files exist for lidar and bathymetry and are available for download. The lidar was collected on 03/23/2011, 12/08/2011, and 12/11/2011. The bathymetry points were collected in 2006-2007 and 2010. The bathymetry data were collected at a 5 meter resolution while the lidar data were collected at a 1 meter resolution. For the UMRR Program, the lidar was processed from bluff to bluff, which was a 1 km buffer from the land cover use study area boundary. In some areas of the river system, lidar was not collected to the full 1 km boundary. To ensure some overlap, the north and south boundaries of the study area were buffered 100 meters and the east and west boundaries used the 1 km buffered boundary. In areas where there were no bathymetry data available, an aquatic area was given a water surface elevation. Any areas within the main channel of the Mississippi River that did not have bathymetry data were represented as water surface elevation from the hydroflattened DEMs.</supplinf>

                <procdesc>Using LP360, ground lidar points were exported within 2-m of aquatic areas that contained bathymetry points. The lidar points were also exported as point shapefiles and were separated by river miles. These lidar point shapefiles are considered near-shore terrestrial points that are used later during bathymetry interpolation.</procdesc>

            <procstep>
                <procdesc>An intermediate Triangulated Irregular Network (TIN) was generated from the near-shore lidar and bathymetry data to identify areas where additional contours were added to alleviate interpolation of lidar data across water bodies. This was accomplished by assigning a very extreme elevation value to the shoreline, thus these extreme values in the TIN represent areas where no bathymetry data exists in aquatic areas. Because of the differences in the minimum elevation of the lidar due to water levels, the spacing of contours varies. In some cases, contours were spaced 1, 10, 15, and 30 meters from the lidar boundary in the areas identified from the intermediate TIN. In other cases, a single contour at 5 meters was used. An elevation was assigned to each contour based on the minimum lidar elevation within a 1-m buffer onto land for each unique arc by river mile. This minimum elevation was used to assign an elevation to each contour by subtracting 0.061, 0.152, and 0.244 meters from the minimum elevation for the 10-, 15-, and 30-m contours, respectively. The 1 and 5 meter contours were assigned the minimum elevation.</procdesc>
