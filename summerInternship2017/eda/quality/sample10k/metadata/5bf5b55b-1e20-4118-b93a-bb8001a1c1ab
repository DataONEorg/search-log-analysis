      <abstract>This data set is a digital representation of the printed 1:250,000 geologic
maps from the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation,
Division of Geology.  The coverage was designed primarily to provide a
more detailed geologic base than the 1:2,500,000 King and Beikman (1974).
1:24,000 scale coverage of the state is available for about 40 percent of
the state. Formation names and geologic unit codes used in the coverage are from
the Tennessee Division of Geology published maps and may not conform to USGS
nomenclature. The Tennessee Division of Geology can be contacted at (615) 532-1500
			</abstract>
      <purpose>The data set was developed to determine relative geology at scales suitable
for use at a scale 1:250,000.  The data set should not be used in
situations where positional accuracy is an issue.

      <supplinf>Procedures_Used:

SCANNING THE LINEWORK
The Tennessee Division of Geology provided the negatives and/or
scribecoats for the west, west-central, east-central, and east map sheets
for the 1:250,000 Geologic Map of Tennessee.  The negatives for the west
and west-cetral sheets were scanned and saved as TIF image files at 400
dpi black and white using a Contex FSS-3012t scanner.  Positives were made
from the scribecoats for the east-central and east sheets.  The positives
were scanned using the same system.  The resulting images were transferred
to a Unix workstation for processing in Arc/Info 7.0.
		
GEO-REFERENCING
The original negatives and scribecoats did not have any positional tic marks
which could be used for geo-referencing.  The 1:250,000 USGS Tennessee state
boundary had to be used as a reference.  Each of the four scanned images
were geo-referenced into the Universal Transverse Mercator Zone 16
coordinate system using the Arc/Info REGISTER command.  Because of the
lack of positional registration on the source material, positional accuracy
cannot be guaranteed.
		
DELINEATION
Due to time contraints and personnel shortage, hand delineation of the
geologic features was not possible.  An automated method of delineation
from the scanned data was tested.  The images were converted into GRIDs
using the Arc/Info IMAGEGRID command.  Several attempts at automated
delineation were made using the GRIDLINE command.  After several variations
on command parameters, the resulting linework was acceptable and passed
onto the next step.
		
CLEANING
The linework resulting from the GRIDLINE command was a good conversion
from the raster data, but many problems had to be solved. Because of scanner
limitations, some of the closer linework merged together into single lines.
These had to be deleted and digitzed by hand.  There were many spots where
linework had "spider-webbed". This occurred where the linework was close
but not close enough to merge and cause the automated delineation to create
spurious lines between the actual lines.  These extraneous lines were
removed as well.  After linework errors were corrected, the resulting
linework was passed through the SPLINE command in ArcEdit. This smoothed out
most of the jagged linework caused by the GRIDLINE command.  As a side
effect, fault lines were altered where intersected by other linework.  Some
of these effects were corrected when they were visible on a paper plot while
most were left as they were for future correction.  After errors were
corrected, polygons were built from the linework and then checked for
closure.  Errors found were corrected and the coverage was rebuilt.  This
process was repeated for each of the four sheets until all obvious errors
were corrected.
		
ATTRIBUTION
Once the linework was clean, each line was then tagged as being a nonfault,
fault, or metamorphic isograd. During this tagging, more errors were found
and corrected.  Polygons were attributed with the geologic symbol code found
on the printed maps.  During this process, more errors were found with unclosed
polygons which were fixed and retagged.  Each of the four sheets went
through this process.  Each sheet was then plotted to scale using a custom
Arc/Info shadeset designed to mimic the printed shade patterns as closely as
possible. This process allowed easier verification of the geologic formation
attribution.  Any errors in linework, line attribution, and polygon
attribution were corrected. Geologic symbol codes were based on the published
Tennessee Division of Geology maps and may not conform to USGS nomenclature.
		
MERGING
The two sheets for western Tennessee were appended together.  The resulting
linework at the sheet boundaries had to be cleaned and the map boundaries
removed.  The polygons were then checked for correct attribution along the
map boundary and any errors were corrected.  The same process was repeated
for the eastern Tennessee sheets.  The two resulting coverages where then
merged into a single coverage using the same process of removing map
boundaries and checking/correcting polygon and line features and
attribution.  Once all four sheets were merged into a single coverage, all
polygons with an area of less than 5,000 square meters were removed.  These
polygons were impossible to recognize when plotted at scale and, in most
cases, were "spider-webbing" errors not found during the inital delineation
process.
		
Revisions:
Many revisions were made to the coverage as internal reviews found linework
errors and polygon tagging errors.  This is the first revision to undergo
outside review.
		
Reviews_Applied_to_Data:
In-house reviews have been completed for the linework and polygon tagging.
Reviews were also completed by the Tennessee Division of Geology.
		
Related_Spatial_and_Tabular_Data_Sets:
A set of four ASCII text files contain transcriptions of the printed
explanations found at the bottom of the four printed 1:250,000 geologic
maps.  The explanations may be converted to digital form as time and funds
allow.

Notes:
This data set should not be used in applications where legal decisions may
arise. Several limitations have influenced the overall accuracy and quality
of this data set.  Quality and conditon of the source material was
acceptable at best.  The scribecoats were in poor condition which resulted
in a lengthy clean up process for the eastern half of the data set.  The
scanner used had an acceptable resolution for this project, but a higher
resolution would have resulted in better quality linework.  The lack of
positional registration marks on the source material effected the quality
of the geo-referencing.  The coverage needs to be checked against the
available 1:24,000 geologic quadrangles and adjustments made by a qualified
geologist.

    <overview>
      <eaover>The .AAT file contains one user-defined attribute, FAULT.  This field
defines each line in the dataset as being one of three types.  The
line is either 1 - a nonfault line, 2 - a fault line, 3 - a metamorphic
isograd.  Some lines are not visible on the printed maps due to the
unknown boundary of geologic formations.  These lines were not
differentiated in the digital coverage but may be in future revisions.
The .PAT file contains one user-defined attribute, GEO.  This field
is a representation of the geologic symbol or code found on the printed
maps.  'NONE' is used where the map was blank and 'WATR' is used in
the Western half of Tennessee, where geologic formations were not delineated
beyond water boundaries.
