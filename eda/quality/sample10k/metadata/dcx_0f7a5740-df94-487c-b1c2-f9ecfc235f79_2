(1) transpiration data collected from 2009 to 2010 at two sites: the University of Alaska campus and at Bonanza Creek. On campus, the data were collected from two boreal forest sites, one with stable and one with unstable permafrost. At Bonanza Creek, data were collected at two sites, one was a birch willow shrubland and the other was a black spruce forest... both have stable permafrost. Data were collected from 9am to 3pm with  LiCor 1600 porometer. The data were leaf area corrected when necessary. The DryRite was changed every day. (2) Soil information collected at the same sites as the transpiration data. This file includes depth of different soil types and gravimetric and bulk density data. (3) Soil moisture release curves for the smith lake 3 &amp; gradient birch willow sites, and a tundra site on the Seward Peninsula &amp; in Barrow. This data is to convert gravimetric data to water potential. (4) thaw depth for the smith lake and bonanza creek sites.</dcterms:abstract><dcterms:accessRights>intellectualPropertyRights</dcterms:accessRights><dcterms:accessRights/><dcterms:accessRights/><dcterms:spatial xsi:type="dcterms:Box">northlimit=64.501; southlimit=64.5; eastlimit=-147.426; westlimit=-147.424</dcterms:spatial></dcTerms></metadata>
