      <abstract>This part of DS 781 presents 2-m-resolution Reson 7125 data for the acoustic-backscatter map of Offshore of Monterey map area, California. These metadata describe acoustic-backscatter data collected and processed by California State University, Monterey Bay (CSUMB), Seafloor Mapping Lab and processed into a map sheet by the U.S. Geological Survey. The raster data files are included in "Backscatter_7125_Monterey.zip," which is accessible from http://dx.doi.org/10.5066/F7F47M6T.
This 2-m-resolution Reson 7125 acoustic backscatter map of Offshore of Monterey map area, California, was generated from backscatter data collected by California State University, Monterey Bay (CSUMB) using a 200-kHz/400-kHz Reson 7125 multibeam echosounder. Within the final imagery, brighter tones indicate higher backscatter intensity, and darker tones indicate lower backscatter intensity. The intensity represents a complex interaction between the acoustic pulse and the seafloor, as well as characteristics within the shallow subsurface, providing a general indication of seafloor texture and composition. Backscatter intensity depends on the acoustic source level; the frequency used to image the seafloor; the grazing angle; the composition and character of the seafloor, including grain size, water content, bulk density, and seafloor roughness; and some biological cover. Harder and rougher bottom types such as rocky outcrops or coarse sediment typically return stronger intensities (high backscatter, lighter tones), whereas softer bottom types such as fine sediment return weaker intensities (low backscatter, darker tones).

        <procdesc>During the CSUMB mapping missions, an Applanix POS MV (Position and Orientation System for Marine Vessels)or a Teledyne TSS HDMS (Hydrographic Data Maintenance System) was used to provide position and attitude data during data collection, and they also accounted for vessel motion such as heave, pitch, and roll with navigational input from Trimble 4700 GPS or Cnav®-enabled NAVCON 2050 GPS receivers. Kinetic GPS (KGPS) altitude data were used to account for tide cycle fluctuations, and sound-velocity profiles were collected with an Applied Microsystems (AM) SVPlus sound velocimeter. Soundings were corrected for vessel motion using the Applanix POS MV or Teledyne TSS HDMS data, for variations in water-column sound velocity using the AM SVPlus data, and for variations in water height (tides) using vertical-position data from postprocessed GPS data. The Reson backscatter data were postprocessed using a variety of methods including Geocoder software, Isis Sonar and Delph Map software, and TNT Mips GIS software. For the data postprocessed using Geocoder, the backscatter intensities were radiometrically corrected (including despeckling and angle-varying gain adjustments), and the position of each acoustic sample was geometrically corrected for slant range on a line-by-line basis. After the lines were corrected, they were mosaicked into 1- or 2-m-resolution images. Overlap between parallel lines was resolved using a priority table whose values were based on the distance of each sample from the ship track, with samples that were closest to and furthest from the ship track being given the lowest priority. An anti-aliasing algorithm was also applied. The mosaics were then exported as georeferenced TIFF images, imported into a Geographic Information System (GIS), and converted to GRIDs at 1-m resolution. For the backscatter data postprocessed using the Isis, Delph Map, and TNT Mips method, individual tracklines were replayed and bottom tracking of the sonar was supervised to aid in proper slant-range correction. Line files were snipped to remove portions with poor imagery from the beginning and (or) end of the trackline. Tracklines were then corrected for slant-range and layback, and the position data for each line was smoothed using a speed filter. Each line was then gridded, georeferenced, and exported from Isis Sonar/Delph Map in GeoTIFF format. Individual trackline TIFF images were imported into TNT Mips GIS software and areas of poor image quality were extracted and removed. Individual tracklines were then overlaid to produce a mosaic image. Geotiffs were exported from TNT Mips, imported into a GIS and converted to GRIDs at 2-m spatial resolution (California State University, Monterey Bay, Seafloor Mapping Lab, 2015)</procdesc>

Backscatter grids from similar mapping systems were merged together in a GIS and clipped to the boundary of the map area.

    <techpreq>The downloadable data file has been compressed with the "zip" command and can be unzipped with Winzip (or other tool) on Windows systems. To utilize these data, the user must have software capable of uncompressing the WinZip file and importing and viewing an Esri ArcMap TIFF. Users should download the ArcGIS Project File, OffshoreMontereyGIS.mxd.zip, a compressed (with the "zip" command) version of the ArcMap document (.mxd) that has all the data layers loaded in the table of contents for "Offshore of Monterey map area" and has all the data symbolized as on the data release map sheets. Download and save this ArcGIS project file, including all data layers, to the directory the user has created for this GIS.</techpreq>
