      <abstract>This data set represents the estimated percentage of the 1-km grid cell that is covered by or subject to the agricultural conservation practice (CP428), Irrigation Water Conveyance by Ditch and Canal (IWCDC) on agricultural land by county.  Irrigation Water Conveyance by Ditch and Canal is described as "a fixed lining of impervious material installed in an existing or newly constructed irrigation field ditch or irrigation canal or lateral." (U.S. Department of Agriculture, 1995) This data set was created with geographic information systems (GIS) and database management tools. The acres on which IWCDC's are applied were totaled at the county level in the tabular NRI database and then apportioned to a raster coverage of agricultural land within the county based on the Enhanced National Land Cover Dataset (NLCDe) 1-kilometer resolution land cover grids (Nakagaki, 2003). Federal land is not considered in this analysis because NRI does not record information on those lands.</abstract>
      <purpose>This dataset was created for two main purposes; (1) summarize and provide refined spatial detail to attributes of agricultural practices from the 1992 NRI dataset; and (2) to support hydrologic modeling.  The U. S. Geological Survey's (USGS) National Water-Quality Assessment (NAWQA) program is using the spatially refined IWCDC dataset to produce ancillary information for characterizing surface and ground-water sampling sites. Calculation of percentages of NAWQA study areas treated by Irrigation Water Conveyance by Ditch and Canal is one example of the type of use of this data set. The 1992 NRI data was used because it was created in the same early to mid-1990s time frame as the NLCD. NAWQA plans on processing the NRI in this fashion every 5 years as new NRI and NLCDE data are published.</purpose>
      <supplinf>The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) initiated the National Water-Quality Assessment (NAWQA) Program in 1991 to accomplish two primary objectives. The first objective was to assess the status and trends in the quality of the Nation's ground-water and surface-water resources, and the second objective was to link the status and trends with an understanding of the natural and human factors that affect water quality (Gilliom and others, 1995).
"The National Resources Inventory is a statistically based sample of land-use and natural resource conditions and trends on U.S. nonfederal lands. It is the most comprehensive database of its kind ever attempted anywhere in the world. The Natural Resources Conservation Service's program for NRI serves as the Federal Government's principal source of information on the status, condition, and trends of soil, water, and related resources in the United States. The assessment of a nation's natural resources and environmental condition provided by the NRI requires a nationally consistent database that allows for manipulation of various parameters in order to make accurate assessments. For these manipulations and subsequent analyses to be useful for public policy considerations, the NRI database has a high degree of reliability, looks at the natural resources over a period of time, and permits analyses at national, regional, and local levels. The NRI is unique because it provides a nationally consistent database for all nonfederal lands, it features data gathered and monitored in 1982, 1987, 1992, and 1997 by thousands of technical and natural resource data collection experts, and it has a direct correlation with soils data, which permits analysis of resources in relation to the capability of the land and in terms of soil resources and conditions.  Informed and valid decisions are best made when based upon scientifically derived data. The NRI has been developed to supply this type of information. The NRI database is powerful, credible, and scientifically constructed. The present NRI is the result of many decades of development." (U.S. Department of Agriculture, 1995)

    <useconst>The NRI dataset is tabulated at the county level only and deemed accurate for this analysis (Nusser and Goebel, 1997). The spatial distribution of this data also assumes the NLCDe has an acceptable accuracy for this analysis (Nakagaki, 2003). Therefore this data set does not provide specific locations of a particular NRI code but the percent of county agricultural land that practices NRI code 607 over the total agricultural land in a particular county.</useconst>

      <procstep>
        <procdesc>The reasons for creating this dataset were to (1) summarize and provide refined spatial detail to conservation practices attributes from the 1992 NRI dataset; and (2) to support hydrologic modeling. This dataset was derived by summarizing NRI attributes at the county level and then apportioning these county values to the NLCDe 1-km grid cells identified as agriculture within the appropriate counties. The value of each grid cell represents the estimated percentage of the 1-km grid cell that is covered by or subject to the agricultural conservation practice (CP329), Conservation Tillage Systems on agricultural land by county.  Kerie J. Hitt, USGS, supplied a copy of the 1992 NRI database.  Naomi Nakagaki, USGS, supplied the 1-kilometer updated orchards National Land Cover Dataset  (NLCDe) that was used to apportion the county areally weighted Waste Management System values onto agricultural land located within each county.  The cell value for this NLCDe grid is the percentage of 30-meter resolution grid cells in the 1 by 1 kilometer area with agricultural land cover classification.
			
All percentages are expressed as integer values. Please note that NRI does not include data for federal lands. Therefore, federal lands were excluded from the apportionment calculations and the percentages were based on land areas and county areas of nonfederal lands only.
The process for summarizing and distributing NRI attributes involved the following steps:
			
1) Reclassify all the NRI agricultural land-use categories (See table 1) into one land-use category called cropland. NLCDe land-cover categories (Row Crops, Small Grains Pasture/Hay, Fallow, and Orchards) were used to create the one land-use category called cropland.
			
2) Sum the area of recoded-NRI cropland category for each county in the conterminous United States.
			
3) Sum the treated area of NRI agricultural conservation practice (e.g. IT01, Waste Water Management Systems) for each county in the conterminous United States.
			
4) Calculate the areal percentage of the cropland treated with the agricultural practice for each county in the United States. (i.e., percentage of cropland treated with CPIT01 )
			
5) Recode the 1-km grid cells with the county-specific percentages of CPIT01 treatment, based on each cell's corresponding NLCDe agricultural land-use category and county location.

" NRI data were collected at more than 800,000 sample sites nationwide.   This is a very large sample, which means that the data can be legitimately used to analyze issues at many geographic levels -- national, regional, State, and sub-State (multi-county).  The NRI was not designed to provide statistical estimates for counties or 8-digit hydrologic units; however, examining the data at various geographic levels, including county or 8-digit hydrologic unit, is a legitimate analytical technique for gaining additional insight into the database.  Anyone who intends to work with NRI data, especially at the county or 8-digit hydrologic unit scales, should read carefully the technical guidance as to the suitability and limitations of the data and the error-estimation procedures." (U.S. Department of Agriculture, 1995).
			
The decision to aggregate the NRI to county level was made to facilitate comparisons with other, similar data used by the NAWQA Program, such as the Agricultural Census data, that also were reported at the county level.  Also, the grouping of NRI land-use categories together into one agricultural land-use category was made in order to approximate the NLCDe data set.
Because of space considerations, NLCDe was used which is a resampling of NLCDE and shows the percentage of one particular land use code in NLCDE per 1 square kilometer.  (Nakagaki, 2003)
			
The NRI data was processed into the NLCDE as in the following example:
			
An example computation for a hypothetical county:
			
10 kilometers with CPIT01 on cropland, and total cropland in the county
is 100 kilometers (using the codes selected out for NRI cropland listed
above).
			
This would yield the fraction of cropland with CPIT01 as:
CPIT01 crop = .10 (10/100) for that county.
			
The 1-km resolution NLCDE dataset shows landuse by a 1-kilometer cell-
by-cell basis.  Every 1-kilometer cell value is the percentage of a
particular land-use within it. For a particular cell in that
hypothetical county, NLCD indicates:
			
20% of cell area with row crop, 30% of cell area with pasture hay, and
no orchards. This yields:
NLCDrowcrop(.20) + NLCDpashay(.30) + NLCDorch(0) = NLCDcropland(.50).
			
To determine the amount of CPIT01 for that cell in that hypothetical
county, the calculation would be:
(CPIT01 crop * NLCDcropland) or
(.10 * .50) = .05 or 5% of CPIT01 for that particular cell in the
hypothetical county.
			
NRI data were processed in a MicroSoft ACCESS database. The areas for NRI codes were summed by county and exported into a dBASE-format file. This file was imported into ESRI's ARC/INFO GIS as an INFO table.  The INFO table was relationally joined to an ARC/INFO grid of counties by using the FIPS county code as a relate-key item. Once the NRI numbers were joined with the county grid cells, a GIS function statement (please see above) was then performed on the NLCDE grid to derive the percent of CPIT01 on cropland.  Federal lands were included when applying this GIS function.
			
The aml used for processing was:
			
/*countyg is the grid with NRI numbers by county by NLCDe landuse type
/*fedg is the grid with federal lands as NODATA
/* countyg.%nri%crop is the area of NRI practice on rowcrop land (from

    <overview>
      <eaover>The cell attributes represents the estimated percentage of the 1-km grid cell that is covered by or subject to the agricultural conservation practice (CP428), Irrigation Water Conveyance by Ditch and Canal on agricultural land by county.  Cells with a zero value or NODATA for PCT either have no agricultural land, or NRI reported no usage of conservation practice CP428, or were in counties not included in the NRI survey, or have predominantly federal lands or no land area in their cell.</eaover>
