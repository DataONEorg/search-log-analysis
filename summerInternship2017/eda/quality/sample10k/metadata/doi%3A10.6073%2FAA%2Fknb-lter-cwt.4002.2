The purpose of the data is to characterize the tree stem temperature regimes as they relate to tree stem respiration. Data will continue to be collected until approximately December 1997. Data will then be subsequently summarized and published.</para><para>Tree stem temperature is collected with a thermocouple inserted 2 cm deep into the sapwood. Thermocouples are controlled and measured via a Campbell CR10 datalogger. See additional measurement details in following sections. || A total of thirty-two thermocouples are measured including the array of species present at the site. Trees of all sizes are measured since tree stem temperature in part depends upon the mass of the tree which generates a buffering capacity.  In general, trees are measured on the north side to avoid additional variation
due to solar heating. However, a subset of trees are measured on the south side and compared with measurements on the north side to quantify this difference.</para></abstract><keywordSet><keyword>Coweeta</keyword><keyword>LTER</keyword><keyword>stem temperature</keyword><keyword>respiration</keyword><keyword>sapwood</keyword><keyword>tree diameter</keyword></keywordSet><intellectualRights><para>Must adhere to the Coweeta LTER Data Policy (See http://coweeta.ecology.uga.edu/webdocs/3/static/datapolicies.html).</para></intellectualRights><distribution scope="document"><online><url function="download">http://cwt33.ecology.uga.edu/summaries/summary4002.html</url></online></distribution><coverage scope="document"><geographicCoverage scope="document"><geographicDescription>Coweeta Watershed 18 Cove 218 Gradient Plot</geographicDescription><boundingCoordinates><westBoundingCoordinate></westBoundingCoordinate><eastBoundingCoordinate></eastBoundingCoordinate><northBoundingCoordinate></northBoundingCoordinate><southBoundingCoordinate></southBoundingCoordinate></boundingCoordinates></geographicCoverage><temporalCoverage scope="document"><rangeOfDates><beginDate><calendarDate>1996-05-01</calendarDate></beginDate><endDate><calendarDate>2005-01-01</calendarDate></endDate></rangeOfDates></temporalCoverage></coverage><contact scope="document"><positionName>Coweeta LTER Information Manager</positionName><address scope="document"><deliveryPoint>Institute of Ecology</deliveryPoint><deliveryPoint>University of Georgia</deliveryPoint><city>Athens</city><administrativeArea>Georgia</administrativeArea><postalCode>30602</postalCode><country>USA</country></address><phone phonetype="voice">(828) 524-2128</phone></contact><project scope="document"><title>Coweeta Long Term Ecological Research</title><personnel scope="document"><individualName><givenName>Ted</givenName><surName>Gragson</surName></individualName><address scope="document"><deliveryPoint>Institute of Ecology</deliveryPoint><deliveryPoint>University of Georgia</deliveryPoint><city>Athens</city><administrativeArea>Georgia</administrativeArea><postalCode>30602</postalCode><country>USA</country></address><electronicMailAddress>tgragson@earthlink.net</electronicMailAddress><role>principalInvestigator</role></personnel><personnel scope="document"><individualName><givenName>James</givenName><surName>Vose</surName></individualName><address scope="document"><deliveryPoint>Institute of Ecology</deliveryPoint><deliveryPoint>University of Georgia</deliveryPoint><city>Athens</city><administrativeArea>Georgia</administrativeArea><postalCode>30602</postalCode><country>USA</country></address><electronicMailAddress>jvose@fs.fed.us</electronicMailAddress><role>principalInvestigator</role></personnel><personnel scope="document"><individualName><givenName>Brian</givenName><surName>Kloeppel</surName></individualName><address scope="document"><deliveryPoint>Institute of Ecology</deliveryPoint><deliveryPoint>University of Georgia</deliveryPoint><city>Athens</city><administrativeArea>Georgia</administrativeArea><postalCode>30602</postalCode><country>USA</country></address><electronicMailAddress>kloeppel@sparc.ecology.uga.edu</electronicMailAddress><role>principalInvestigator</role></personnel><abstract><para>The Coweeta LTER Research Program has evolved since 1980 from a site-based to a site- and region-based project examining the effects of disturbance
and environmental gradients on biogeochemical cycling, and the underlying
watershed ecosystem processes that regulate and respond to those cycles. 
The objective for the 2002-2008 research is to advance scientific
understanding of the spatial, temporal, and decision-making components of
land use and land-use change in the southern Appalachian Mountains over the
last 200 years, and forecast patterns into the future 30 years.  This will
be accomplished by addressing ecological and socioeconomic aspects of
land-use change while continuing long-term studies of environmental
gradients and natural disturbance regimes.  The result will be a more
complete understanding of ecological dynamics in the southern Appalachian
Mountains that makes possible the development of reasonable forecasts of
its future ecological state. | The guiding hypothesis for the proposed research is that the frequency, intensity, and extent of land use represents human decision-making in
response to socioeconomic and bio-geophysical conditions with consequences
that cascade through ecosystems.  The research activities are organized
into three initiatives: (1) Characterization of the Socio-Natural Template,
(2) Ecosystem Responses to the Socio-Natural Template, and (3) Forecasting
Ecosystem Responses to Changes in the Socio-Natural Template.  The
integrated scientific research will provide both a description as well as
an explanation of the underlying causes of land use and the consequences of
land-use change for southern Appalachian ecosystems and society.  It thus
recognizes the complexity of land use as a process and the research needs
as defined in the LTER Program and the broader scientific community.</para></abstract><funding><para>National Science Foundation.
