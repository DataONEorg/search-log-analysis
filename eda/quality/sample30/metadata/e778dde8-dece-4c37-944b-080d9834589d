      <abstract>The Coquille River system is an unregulated system that encompasses 2,745 square kilometers of southwestern Oregon and flows into the Pacific Ocean near the town of Bandon, Oregon. Beginning in the Rogue River-Siskiyou National Forest, the South Fork Coquille River gains the Middle Fork Coquille River (drainage area 798 square kilometers) and shortly thereafter the North Fork Coquille River (749 square kilometers). In cooperation with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the U.S. Geological Survey completed a reconnaissance-level assessment of channel condition and bed-material transport relevant to the permitting of in-stream gravel extraction along the the South Fork Coquille River from river kilometer (RKM) 115.4 near its confluence with Upper Land Creek to RKM 58.5 at its confluence with the North Fork Coquille River, the mainstem Coquille River from RKM 58.5 at the confluence of the South and North Forks of the Coquille River to its mouth, the Middle Fork Coquille River from RKM 15.4 to its confluence with the South Fork Coquille River, and the North Fork Coquille River from RKM 14.6 to its confluence with the South Fork Coquille River. To support these analyses, digital channel maps were produced to depict channel and floodplain conditions in the Coquille River basin from different time periods. GIS layers defining the wetted channel and bar features and channel centerline of Hunter Creek were developed for four time periods: 1939, 1967, 2005, and 2009. For this project, the active channel was defined as area typically inundated during annual high flows, and includes the low-flow channel as well as side channels, islands, and channel-flanking gravel bars. The wetted channel and bar feature datasets were developed by digitizing from aerial photographs. Aerial photographs from 1939 and 1967 were scanned, rectified, and mosaicked for this project (See metadata for each photograph set for more information on the rectification process and resolution of each dataset). Digital orthophotographs from 2005 and 2009 are publicly available.</abstract>
      <purpose>These data were created to support preliminary assessment of channel stability and bed-material transport on Coquille, Middle Fork Coquille, and North Fork Coquille Rivers, southwest Oregon. This mapping was used to track changes in channel morphology and planform over time.</purpose>

    <logic>Data are topologically correct in ArcGIS. Topolgy rules were used to edit features and verify that polygons were completely enclosed or did not overlap.</logic>
    <complete>Data are complete. Wetted channel and bar feature mapping was reviewed by a minimum of three other team members to ensure protocol was followed and that mapping was consistent between time periods. Digitizing was done at a scale of 1:3,000 on the South, Middle, and North Fork Coquille Rivers and upstream of river kilometer 24.8 on on the Coquille River. Downstream of river kilometer 24.8 on the Coquille River, digitizing was completed at a scale of 1:10,000. All bar and wetted channel features greater than 300 square meters were digitized. Because polygons were split for assignment to study reaches, some may represent areas less than 300 square meters. Best judgment was used to delineate feature boundaries where obscured by vegetation or shadows.</complete>
    <posacc>
      <horizpa>
        <horizpar>The 1939 and 1967 photographs were georectified with a minimum of eight ground-control points concentrated near the main channel and rectified with a second-order polynomial transformation. The total root mean square error values of the rectified photographs from 1939 and 1967 indicated that horizontal-position uncertainties associated with the georectification process ranged from 1.4 to 6.4 meters for individual photographs, but averaged 3.2 meters for the 1939 photographs and 3.4 meters for the 1967 photographs. Because control points were concentrated near the channel, error associated with mapped features along channel corridor should be lower than the total root mean square error values for the entire photograph. Digitizing was done at a scale of 1:3,000 on the South, Middle, and North Fork Coquille Rivers and upstream of river kilometer 24.8 on on the Coquille River. Downstream of river kilometer 24.8 on the Coquille River, digitizing was completed at a scale of 1:10,000.</horizpar>

While most of the mapped bars had little to no vegetation, some bars included small areas that were partly or wholly covered by grasses, shrubs, and (to a lesser extent) mature trees.</edomvd>
