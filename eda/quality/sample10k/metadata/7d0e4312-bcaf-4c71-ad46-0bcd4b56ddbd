      <abstract>In order to test hypotheses about groundwater flow under and into Chesapeake Bay, geophysical surveys were conducted by U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) scientists on Chesapeake Bay and the Potomac River Estuary in September 2006. Chesapeake Bay resource managers are concerned about nutrients that are entering the estuary via submarine groundwater discharge, which are contributing to eutrophication. The USGS has performed many related studies in recent years to provide managers with information necessary to make informed decisions about this issue. The research carried out as part of the study described here was designed to help refine nutrient budgets for Chesapeake Bay by characterizing submarine groundwater flow and discharge of groundwater beneath part of the mainstem and a major tributary, the Potomac River Estuary.</abstract>
      <purpose>The purpose of this dataset is to provide the raw resistivity data collected on this date by the AGI SuperSting system. In addition, these data are provided in a format ready for processing. In some cases, small edits had to be made to the original raw files to make them suitable for processing.  Both the raw and modified raw files are included. And finally, this dataset acts as a data archive.</purpose>

    <logic>All the data files were checked and handled in the same manner.</logic>
    <complete>These files represent all the raw resistivity files used to process resistivity profile data on this date. In cases where corrections had to be made to the Global Positioning System (GPS) navigation files and/or the raw resistivity files (STG), both the original and corrected files are included.</complete>
    <posacc>
      <horizpa>
        <horizpar>The primary navigation system used was a Lowrance 480M with an LGC-2000 Global Positioning System (GPS) antenna. The antenna was located 7.9 meters forward of the anchor point for the resistivity streamer, and approximately 3 meters forward of the fathometer transducer. These offsets were not entered into the GPS system. Additionally, because of navigation and fathometers issues, periodically the ship's navigation system was used to supplement these data. The ship had a Differential GPS (DGPS) system with the antenna placed in the same location as the Lowrance antenna. The fathometer was located (hull-mounted) roughly directly below the antenna, so no horizontal offset. Because of the mixture of systems, the accuracy is on the order of 20 meters.</horizpar>
      </horizpa>
      <vertacc>
        <vertaccr>On this day most of the bathymetric values were collected by the Lowrance fathometer. This fathometer was mounted mid-ship on the starboard side of the boat. The Lowrance manufacturer indicates the speed of sound used by the system to convert to depths is 4800 feet/second. The ship's fathometer was hull mounted approximately mid-ship, relatively close to the navigation antenna. All values are assumed to be accurate to within 1 meter.</vertaccr>

        <srccontr>The continuous resistivity profile (CRP) system used on this cruise was an AGI SuperSting marine system described at the website: www.agiusa.com/marinesystem.shtml. The particular system used for this acquisition was a 100-m streamer with an 11 electrode array with electrodes spaced 10 meters apart. The source electrodes are graphite, while the receiver electrodes are stainless steel. A dipole-dipole configuration was used for the data collection in which two fixed current electrodes are assigned with the measurement of voltage potential between electrode pairs in the remaining electrodes. Each line of data acquisition records several files. The two files necessary for processing are the *.stg and the *.gps file. The STG file contains the resistivity data, while the GPS file contains the navigation information. The navigation system used in concert with the CRP system is a Lowrance LMS-480M with an LGC-2000 GPS antenna and a 200 kHz fathometer transducer. The transducer also contains a temperature sensor which was not working on Julian Day 249. Lowrance indicates the speed of sound used by the system is 4800 feet/second. On the first day of data collection (Julian Day 249, Sept. 6, 2006) the Lowrance transducer was side-mounted mid-ship on the port side of the boat. The remainder of the cruise the transducer was side-mounted mid-ship of the starboard side of the boat.
The CRP system images the subsurface electrical properties of an estuarine, riverine or lacustrine environment. Resistivity differences can be attributed to subsurface geology (conductive vs less conductive layers) and hydrogeologic conditions with fresh water exhibiting high resistivity and saline conditions showing low resistivity.</srccontr>

        <procdesc>When the navigation glitched for the Lowrance, records were sent to the GPS file, but the times and fixes were bogus. Chuck Worley discovered the glitches were a result of a bad wire associated with the navigation cable. These bogus records start by recording a time of 000001 with the second record showing a time of 000006. Based on the navigation in the rest of the file which has fixes roughly every five seconds, I'm assuming that although the times themselves are bogus, the time interval in seconds is accurately represented. Based on this, I manually went through the ship's navigation segments and manually removed the records I don't need - keeping only those ship fixes that were closest in time to the fixes I believed I needed. Of course the times in the ship's navigation don't match exactly with the times I need from the Lowrance system as the ship's navigation records a fix every 3 or 4 seconds. But simply keeping the closest ship fix in time all fixes were within 1 second relative to the resistivity navigation fix I needed. The resulting files are *trim.txt (where the * refers to the initial gap files from the ship navigation).</procdesc>

        <procdesc>Edits to the metadata were made to fix any errors that MP v 2.9.34 flagged. This is necessary to enable the metadata to be successfully harvested for various data catalogs. In some cases, this meant adding text "Information unavailable" or "Information unavailable from original metadata" for those required fields that were left blank. Other minor edits were probably performed (title, publisher, publication place, etc.). The source information was incomplete and had to be modified to meet the standard. The distribution format name was modified in an attempt to be more consistent with other metadata files of the same data format. The metadata date (but not the metadata creator) was edited to reflect the date of these changes. The metadata available from a harvester may supersede metadata bundled within a download file. Compare the metadata dates to determine which metadata file is most recent.</procdesc>
