      <abstract>This data set represents the state (political)
boundaries of Mexico. The Digitial Chart of the World data set
had incomplete state boundaries, which was the reason to create
this coverage. It was digitized from a 1992
CIA map at a scale of 1:3 million. The coast line
came from the Digital Chart of the world at a scale
of 1:1 million. The state names were labeled from the
map and an attribute to help fill the states was added. The
labeling process was done manually.
			</abstract>
      <purpose>The purpose of this state is to fill a need for the
state boundaries for all of Mexico. It was collected
for the National Atlas project with the intentions to
be released to the USGS and be used in reports and on
maps that show all or part of Mexico.

      <procstep>
        <procdesc>To produce this data set, I went first to the Map and Air photo Library on the
UW-Madison campus and found a map at 1:3,000,000 map of Mexico created by the
Central Intelligence Agency. I choose 6 latitude and longitude points for tic
referneces. Then using an aml called create.aml I created an empty coverage
using the 6 lat/long values I picked. I then ran another aml called digitize
that sets up the digitizer with tolerances and allows me to digitize. Here
is the digitize aml:
ae
&amp;watch extent.wat &amp;append
coordinate digitizer org_data
&amp;pause write down rms error
&amp;s goof [response 'Is rms error ok (less than .004)?']
&amp;if %goof% = n &amp;then &amp;call abort
editcover org_data
de arcs
ef arcs
display 4208
draw
weedtolerance .005
snapping closest .005
snapcover org_data
ia all
add
save
&amp;do &amp;while [query 'Do you wish to continue digitizing']
add
save
&amp;end
q
&amp;watch &amp;off
&amp;type all done with digitizing session
&amp;return
&amp;routine abort
&amp;type 'RMS to high need to start over, make sure to type &amp;watch &amp;off'
&amp;type 'and cd back to the aml directory, before starting again.'
&amp;stop
The digitized coverage was in digitizer units and called org_data. After
digitizing, I plotted the coverage on our calcomp electrostatic plotter and
checked for gaps between the data source and the digitized line. Where there
was a gap greater than a line weight it was corrected. The coverages was then
transformed to a labert projection using the following standards:
projection lambert
units meters
parameters
19 00 00
29 20 00
-96 00 00
13 00 00
0.0
0.0
The transformation used 5 of the 6 tics with and RMS error of .005 input and
366 meters output. Then the coverage was projected to albers using the
following projection file:
INPUT
PROJECTION LAMBERT
UNITS meters
PARAMETERS
19 00 00
29 20 00
-96 00 00
13 00 00
0.0
0.0
OUTPUT
PROJECTION ALBERS
UNITS METERS
PARAMETERS
29 30 00
45 30 00
-96 00 00
23 00 00
end

After the coverage was projected into albers it was then put into a coverage
consisting of the outline of Mexico. This outline came from the Digital Chart
of the World (DCW). This coverage was tiled together by David McCulloch of the
Florida District Suboffice in Tampa, Fl. After the digitized state lines were
put into the outline coverage to create the mexico coverage, all dangles were
then edited. Due to an oversight by me (John Watermolen) during an edit session
the precision of the coverage went from double to single. Before Documentation
I did the following steps to return the coverage to double precision:
rename &lt;coverage&gt; &lt;coverage_s&gt;
copy &lt;coverage_s&gt; &lt;coverage&gt; double
kill &lt;coverage_s&gt; all
Once in final form, I then built the coverage for arc and polygon
topology. After this I then added the state name and differentiated the
boundaries into the following catagories:
Boundary = 1 is the coastline
Boundary = 5 is state boundaries
Boundary = 10 is International boundaries

There is a watch file called mexico.wat that has a history of the creation of
the data set. I deleted the actual digitizing points and editing points to
make the watch file more manageable. The watch file is in the notes
section of this narrative.
Here is a lineage of the coverages that led to Mexico:
org_data- original digitized datset in digitizer units
mexico_lam - is the transformed coverage form digitizer units to lambert
projection.
mex_alb- is the albers projection from the lambert projection

Other files and coverages used to create the files:
west_hem- outline from the DCW
mexico_ll, mexico_ll2 and mexico_ll3 are projection and ascii files used to
help transform the coverage from digitizer units to a projected coverage.

The data was reviewed by John Hutchinson of the Eros Data Center and by
David McCulloch of the USGS-WRD Florida District Tampa office
On June 4th I made 2 additions to the data set that were noted in the metadata
review along with the review of the data. I added Isla Montagua, which was deleted
from the DCW coastline and I added Cabo Rojo which was over generalized in the DCW
coastline. My RMS error for the digitizing session .002"/160 m

are:
Boundary- which describes the differnet types of boundaries

Boundary = 5 are the state boundaries
Boundary = 10 are the international boundaries

The items for polygons not internal to ARC/INFO are:
Fill and State Name. The codes for Fill are:
fill = y polygon should be filled
fill = n polygon shouldn't be filled
For state name, it is a characater string. If this field is blank,
the polygon represents an island
