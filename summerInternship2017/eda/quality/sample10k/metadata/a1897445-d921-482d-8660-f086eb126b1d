      <abstract>

This data set represents the average annual nitrogen input from
confined animal manure, 1992 and 1997, in kilograms per hectare,
in the conterminous United States.

The data set was used as an input data layer for a national
model to predict nitrate concentration in shallow ground water.

Nolan and Hitt (2006) developed two national models to predict
contamination of ground water by nonpoint sources of
nitrate. The nonlinear approach to national-scale Ground-WAter
Vulnerability Assessment (GWAVA) uses components representing
nitrogen (N) sources, transport, and attenuation.

One model (GWAVA-S) predicts nitrate contamination of shallow
(typically less than 5 meters deep), recently recharged ground
water, which may or may not be used for drinking.  The other
(GWAVA-DW) predicts ambient nitrate concentration in deeper
supplies used for drinking.

This data set is one of 17 data sets (1 output data set and 16
input data sets) associated with the GWAVA-S model. Full details
of the model development are in Nolan and Hitt (2006).

For inputs to the model, spatial attributes representing 16
nitrogen loading and transport and attenuation factors were
compiled as raster data sets (1-km by 1-km grid cell size) for
the conterminous United States (see table 1).

      <purpose>

This particular data layer was created to help characterize
nitrogen sources at a national level for input to a national
model to predict nitrate concentration in shallow ground water.

Nitrate is considered to be the most widespread contaminant in
ground water. High nitrate concentration in ground water is a
concern for human health, and protecting drinking water sources
is a national priority.  The U.S. Geological Survey's National
Water-Quality Assessment (NAWQA) Program monitors the occurrence
and distribution of nitrate and other contaminants in ground
water and streams. However, because monitoring everywhere for
the occurrence and distribution of nitrate in ground water is
impractical, national water-quality models are used to address
data gaps. The goal of the current study was to predict ground
water vulnerability to nitrate at the national scale, to
complement measured data.

Water-quality data used in this study were collected during
1991-2003 and represent the first full decade of sampling by the
NAWQA program. The input data layers describe conditions in the
mid 1990's, and so the predictions represent mid 1990's land-use
and nitrogen-loading conditions.

This spatial data set is one of a group of data sets developed
specifically for use in a national model of nitrate in ground
water.  The data set should be used at the national or regional
level, not at the local level.

Users should consider the various assumptions that went into
generating each spatial data set and the limitations inherent in
the source data materials in deciding whether the data set is
appropriate for use in other national or regional applications.

Please acknowledge the U.S. Geological Survey in products derived
from these data.

The data set is the source for county estimates of total
nitrogen (N) inputs from manure from confined animals (1982,
1987, 1992, 1997).  The data set is in tabular format,
organized by county code.  The units are kilograms of N per
year.  For the model, county N input from confined animals was
calculated as the average of the N input from confined animals
for 1992 and 1997, to represent the decade of water quality
sampling conducted by NAWQA.

The county data was apportioned to mapped agricultural land
use.

NLCD 92 (National Land Cover Dataset 1992) is a 21-category
land cover classification scheme that has been applied
consistently over the conterminous United States. It is based
primarily on the unsupervised classification of Landsat TM
(Thematic Mapper) 1992 imagery. Ancillary data sources
included topography, census, agricultural statistics, soil
characteristics, other land cover maps, and wetlands data. The
NLCD 92 classification is provided as raster data with a
spatial resolution of 30 meters.

A 30-m spatial resolution version of this land use and land
cover (LULC) data set was used to develop an enhanced version
of the NLCD 92 (called NLCDE 92) at 30-meter and 1-kilometer
resolutions using methods described in:

Nakagaki, N., and Wolock, D.M., 2005, Estimation of
agricultural pesticide use in drainage basins using land cover
maps and county pesticide data:  U.S. Geological Survey
Open-File Report 2005-1188, pp.4-10.

The LULC data were derived from aerial photography, and NLCD
92 data were derived from satellite imagery. The NLCD was
modified with selected land-use categories of LULC, as
described in Nakagaki and Wolock (2005), because LULC data are
a better source for some land categories that are difficult to
distinguish using only satellite imagery (residential,
orchards/vineyards/other, and tundra). The enhanced NLCD
(NLCDE 92) includes 21 land-cover classifications from the
original NLCD 92 plus an additional four categories from the
LULC (LULC tundra, NLCD/LULC forested residential, LULC
residential, and LULC orchards/vineyards/other) (Nakagaki and
Wolock, 2005).

The 30-m resolution NLCDE 92 was used to create a set of 25
1-km resolution national grids of "percentage" land cover (one
grid for each land cover class) using methods described in
Nakagaki and Wolock (2005), pages 10-13.

In each 1-km resolution national grid, the value of a grid
cell was the percentage of the 1 km by 1 km area specific to
that land cover class. For example, the grid of "pasture/hay"
indicated the percentage of pasture/hay in each cell, and the
grid of "row crops" indicated the percentage of row crops in
each cell.

Spatial data sets representing nitrogen (N) loading and
transport and attenuation factors were compiled for the
conterminous United States.

N source variables include farm fertilizer, manure from
confined animal feeding operations, and loading surrogates
that reflect additional sources of N. For example, population
density is a surrogate for nonagricultural sources of N from
septic tanks, sewers, and domestic animal waste in urban
areas.

Transport factors include water input, sediments, rock type,
and selected management practices.  "Water input" is an
interaction term expressed as the ratio of the total area of
irrigated land to precipitation.  Attenuation factors include
variables that are surrogates for dilution and/or
denitrification.

Each of the variables in the model was compiled within 1-km by
1-km grid cells for prediction of nitrate concentration at the
national scale.

A national grid of average (1992 and 1997) N input from
confined animal manure was generated by adding a spatial
component to tabular county estimates of N from confined
manure presented in Ruddy and others (2006). Mapped
agricultural land cover from NLCDE 92 1-km resolution GRIDS
was used to spatially refine the geographic location of N from
manure from countywide tables to agricultural land within a
county.

In each NLCDE 92 1-km resolution national grid, the value of a
grid cell was the percentage of the 1 km by 1 km area specific
to that land cover class.  If a 1-km2 cell contained 78
percent agricultural land, this translated to .78 km2 of
agricultural land in the cell.

Agricultural land where confined manure was applied was defined
as the sum of these four percentage land cover classifications
from NLCDE 92:

&gt; 81      Pasture/hay
&gt; 82      Row crops
&gt; 83      Small grains
&gt; 84      Fallow

The assumption was that confined manure was applied equally to
these land cover categories.

A 1-km resolution national grid of N input from confined
manure was generated using steps similar to those used to
generate a 1-km resolution pesticide use grid described in
Nakagaki and Wolock (2005), pages 17-20.  The steps were:

1. Compute the county area of NLCDE 92 pasture/hay, row crops,
small grains, and fallow land cover classifications (in
each county in the conterminous United States.

a. The 1-km grid of percent values of pasture/hay, row
crops, small grains, and fallow land was converted to a
grid of km2 of agricultural land by dividing the value of
each cell (percent) by 100.

b. The area of pasture/hay, row crops, small grains, and
fallow land was summed for each county by overlaying the
cell values (km2) of the areal grid with a 1-km resolution
county grid.

2. Compute the county "intensity" (or "rate") of N input
for each county in the conterminous United States.

The "intensity" was computed by dividing the N input for
the county (kg) by the county area of pasture/hay, row
crops, small grains, and fallow land computed in step 1b
(km2).

The "intensity" data was linked to the 1-km national county
grid using county FIPS codes.

3. Create a national grid of estimated N input to pasture/hay, row
crops, small grains, and fallow land.

The cell values of the areal grid of km2 of pasture/hay, row
crops, small grains, and fallow land (step 1a) were
multiplied by the cell values of the areal grid of county N
input "intensity" (step 2).  The cell values of the final
grid represent the kg of N input for each 1 km by 1 km
cell.

Here is an example of how N input for one 1-km2 cell in Pierce
County, Nebraska (FIPS 31119) was generated:

&gt;Step 1a. Percent of NLCDE 92 pasture/hay, row crops, small
&gt;grains, and fallow in cell = 13, so the amount of NLCDE 92 ag
&gt;land in cell = .13 km2
&gt;Step 1b. Total area of NLCDE 92 pasture/hay, row crops, small
&gt;grains, and fallow in county = 1,302.17 km2
&gt;Step 2. Total confined manure N input in county = 2,055,140.0 kg
&gt;(average for 1992 and 1997, calculated from Ruddy and others, 2006)
&gt;
&gt;County "intensity" = 2,055,140 kg / 1302.17 km2 =  1578.24 kg/km2
&gt;
&gt;Step 3. Amount of confined manure N input in cell = .13 km2 *
&gt;1578.2 kg/km2 = 205.172 kg
&gt;The sum of confined manure N input calculated for all cells
&gt;in Pierce county (FIPS 31119) equals 11,334,608.8 kg.

These steps were repeated for all cells nationwide to generate
a preliminary 1-km resolution national grid. Each cell value
represented the amount (kg) of N input from confined manure in
the cell.  The values were converted to kg/hectare (kg/ha) by
multiplying each value by .01.

Preliminary runs of the model resulted in unrealistically high
nitrate predictions (more than 100 mg/L) in some areas. To
prevent the model from overestimating nitrate concentration,
sensitive input variables (population density, farm
fertilizer, confined manure, and water input) were examined to
establish criteria for removing input cells with values above
certain thresholds.  The filtered input values were then put
into the model. Because the model was based on network
averages of inputs, all of the grid cells could have been
averaged, but to preserve as much resolution as possible, only
"problem" cells were averaged.

The threshold established for confined manure N input was 300
kg/ha.

The "raw" confined manure N input numbers were filtered as
follows:

a) If the original confined manure N input was less than or
equal to 300 kg/ha, the original confined manure N input value
was written to the confined manure N input output grid.

b) If the original confined manure N input was greater than
300 kg/ha, a mean was calculated for that cell using the GRID
function FOCALMEAN. FOCALMEAN computed the mean of selected
cells surrounding the input cell using a 9 by 9 rectangular
neighborhood of cells. Each cell was weighted equally except
for the input cell itself, which was weighted zero and was
excluded from the calculation. The MEAN of the surrounding
cells was assigned to the output grid for confined manure N
input.

&gt;manfmha =  selectmask((focalmean(rawman,weight,kernel9x9.txt)),rawman)

The kernel file (kernel9x9.txt) used to specify the 9 by 9
rectangular neighborhood of cells and the weight of each cell
used by FOCALMEAN was:

&gt;9 9
&gt;1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
&gt;1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
&gt;1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
&gt;1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
&gt;1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1
&gt;1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
&gt;1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
&gt;1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
&gt;1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1

The filtered grid of confined manure N input then was used as
input to the GWAVA-S model.

To make the national map of predicted nitrate concentration,
the values from the 1-km by 1-km grid cells for each of the
input data layers were put in to the model equation to
calculate a predicted concentration for each output cell.  An
output cell was assigned a value of "no data" if any of the
corresponding input data cells at that location was "no data."

The following ArcInfo Workstation GRID commands produced the
predicted nitrate concentration grid:

&gt;/*Nonlinear regression model 1 for nitrate in shallow ground water

GRID cells were randomly selected from this data set and were
checked by hand to ensure the correct values were calculated
using the model equation and the input data layers.

Areas with high N load, low to moderate clay content,
sufficient water input, and low denitrification potential have
the highest predicted nitrate concentration in ground water
and therefore may be vulnerable to nitrate contamination.  The
most extensive areas of predicted, severe contamination
(nitrate greater than 10 mg/L) occur in the High Plains, and
areas of predicted, moderate contamination (more than 5 to 10
mg/L nitrate) occur extensively in the northern Midwest.
