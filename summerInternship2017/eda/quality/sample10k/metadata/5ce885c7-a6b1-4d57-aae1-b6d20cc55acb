      <abstract>This data set consists of digitized water-level elevation
contours for the Central Oklahoma aquifer in central
Oklahoma. This area encompasses all or part of Cleveland,
Lincoln, Logan, Oklahoma, Payne, and Pottawatomie
Counties. The Central Oklahoma aquifer includes the alluvial
and terrace deposits along major streams, the Garber
Sandstone and Wellington Formations, and the Chase, Council
Grove, and Admire Groups. The Quaternary-age alluvial and
terrace deposits consist of unconsolidated clay, silt, sand,
and gravel. The Permian-age Garber Sandstone and Wellington
Formations consist of sandstone with interbedded siltstone
and mudstone. The Permian-age Chase, Council Grove, and
Admire Groups consist of sandstone, shale, and thin
limestone.

The Central Oklahoma aquifer underlies about 3,000 square
miles of central Oklahoma where the aquifer is used
extensively for municipal, industrial, commercial, and
domestic water supplies. Most of the usable ground water
within the aquifer is from the Garber Sandstone and Wellington
Formations. Substantial quantities of usable ground water
also are present in the Chase, Council Grove, and Admire
Groups, and in alluvial and terrace deposits associated with
the major streams.

The water-level elevation map was created from digital data
sets developed to produce a map for a previously published
report. Water-levels measured in wells during the winter of
1986 and 1987 were used to construct the map. The digital
data set contains water-level elevations that range from 850
to 1,350 feet above sea level or the National Geodetic
Vertical Datum of 1929 (NGVD29).

      <purpose>This data set was created for a project to develop data sets to
support ground-water vulnerability analysis. The objective was
to create and document a digital geospatial data set from a
published report or map, or existing digital geospatial data
set that could be used in ground-water vulnerability analysis.

      <supplinf>Introduction --

This data set consists of digitize water-level elevation
contours for the Central Oklahoma aquifer in central
Oklahoma. This area encompasses all or part of Cleveland,
Lincoln, Logan, Oklahoma, Payne, and Pottawatomie Counties. The
Central Oklahoma aquifer includes the alluvial and terrace
deposits along major streams, the Garber Sandstone and
Wellington Formations, and the Chase, Council Grove, and Admire
Groups described in the report, "Ground-water-quality assessment
of the Central Oklahoma aquifer, Oklahoma: Geochemical and
Geohydrologic Investigations," by Parkhurst, Christenson, and
Breit (1996). The Quaternary-age alluvial and terrace deposits
consist of unconsolidated clay, silt, sand, and gravel. The
Permian-age Garber Sandstone and Wellington Formations consist
of sandstone with interbedded siltstone and mudstone. The
Permian-age Chase, Council Grove, and Admire Groups consist of
sandstone, shale, and thin limestone (Parkhurst, Christenson,
and Breit, 1996).

The Central Oklahoma aquifer underlies about 3,000 square
miles of central Oklahoma where the aquifer is used
extensively for municipal, industrial, commercial, and
domestic water supplies. Most of the usable ground water
within the aquifer is from the Garber Sandstone and Wellington
Formations. Substantial quantities of usable ground water
also are present in the Chase, Council Grove, and Admire
Groups, and in alluvial and terrace deposits associated with
the major streams (Parkhurst, Christenson, and Breit, 1996).

The water-level elevation map was prepared and published at a
scale of 1:250,000 as figure 2 on sheet 1 of the report,
"Hydrogeologic maps of the Central Oklahoma aquifer,
Oklahoma," by Christenson, Morton, and Mesander (1992) from
water-levels measured in wells during the winter of 1986 and
1987. The digital water-level elevation data set in this
report was created from the digital data sets developed to
produce the maps in Christenson, Morton, and Mesander (1992).

In this report, elevation refers to distance above sea level
and sea level refers to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum
of 1929 (NGVD29)--a geodetic datum derived from a general
adjustment of the first-order level nets of both the United
States and Canada, formerly called Sea Level Datum of
1929. The digital data set contains water-level elevations
that range from 850 to 1,350 feet above sea level or NGVD29.

Reviews Applied to Data --

This electronic report was subjected to the same review standard
that applies to all U.S. Geological Survey reports. Reviewers
were asked to check the topological consistency, tolerances,
attribute frequencies and statistics, projection, and geographic
extent. Reviewers were given digital data sets and paper plots
for checking against the source maps to verify the linework and
attributes. The reviewers checked the metadata and a_readme.1st
files for completeness and accuracy.

Related Spatial and Tabular Data Sets --

This data set is one of four digital map data sets being published
together for this aquifer. The four data sets are:

&gt;              aqbound -  aquifer boundaries

&gt;              cond    -  hydraulic conductivity

&gt;              recharg -  aquifer recharge

&gt;              wlelev  -  water-level elevation contours

Digital map data sets of the Oklahoma surficial geology digitized from
1:250,000-scale maps (or 1:125,000-scale maps for the three Oklahoma
panhandle counties) are published separately.

        <procdesc>The digital aquifer boundary data set in this report was
copied from the digital data sets developed to produce the
figures in Christenson, Morton, and Mesander (1992). Map
projection information was not stored with the original data
sets, therefore, the map projection information, Universal
Transverse Mercator (UTM) project, zone 14, North American
Datum of 1927 (NAD27) documented in Christenson, Morton, and
Mesander (1992) was added using the ARC/INFO PROJECTDEFINE
command (ESRI, 1995). The projection was later converted to
the Albers Conical Equal Area, North American Datum of 1983
(NAD83) using the ARC/INFO PROJECT command (ESRI, 1995).

    <overview>
      <eaover>Two attributes are associated with each line in this digital
data set. The first attribute, ELEV, contains the elevation
of the water-level contour, expressed in feet above the
National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 (NGVD29). The second
attribute, LTYPE, contains a code that indicates the line is
solid on the source map.  ELEV is stored in the first major
code (MAJOR1) and LTYPE is stored in the first minor code
(MINOR1) for lines in the Digital Line Graph (DLG) version of
this data set.
