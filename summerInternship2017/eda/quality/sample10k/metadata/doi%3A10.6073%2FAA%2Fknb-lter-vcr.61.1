Tidal height readings, performed at a staff gauge or automatic
tidal station, are usually relative readings (in the sense
that all readings are relative to an arbitrarily set &quot;zero&quot; level). 



Relative readings may be used in tide harmonic analysis and prediction. 




However, if the data is to be used in coastal environmental studies
(tidal flooding frequency, plant zonation boundaries, computation of
tidal datums, etc.), then the relative &quot;zero&quot; of the tidal station will 
have to be tied to a known topographic datum. 



The correction figures listed below convert relative tidal readings
into USGS 1967 reduction level. There are several corrections because
a new one is necessary every time the tide recording equipment
undergoes maintenance work or replacement. 



HOG ISLAND 



Subtract the following figures from the relative tidal data: 



before September 1993                                   2.197
September 1993 through January 1994                     1.862
February 1994 through October 1994                      2.260 


 
TIDAL DATUMS 



The computation  of topographic datums using tidal station data provides 
VCR-LTER researchers with standard topographic levels for use in plant zona\
tion 
and geology surveys, tidal flooding frequency studies etc. 



Tidal datums are being provided for Hog Island and Quinby
(at the mainland). Red Bank is not tied to the USGS net yet. However,
Quinby datums could be used as a good aproximation for those working
at Bronwsville and Phillips Creek. 



The barrier inslands benchmarks were tied to mainland USGS
benchmarks using Survey Grade GPS. In the specific case of Hog Island, 

benchmark FARL was tied to USGS Kiptopeake benchmark. The calculation
of the USGS level of FARL uses the USGC level of Kiptopeake adding the 

relative difference between Kiptopeake and FARL.  The USGS level for
FARL, which is being used for all the Hog Island calculations, is
1.230 meters.  Because their relative difference did not change with
the most recent adjustments, the above datum is still valid. 



The tables below list levels and ranges. A level is a topographical height 
(in this case, height above the USGS 1967 reduction level). The level is 
calculated adding (or subtracting) half of a selected amplitude to the Half\
 
Tide Level(field data based Half Tide level). A range is the amplitude betw\
een 
the selected high and low tide levels. 



Two categories of levels and ranges are listed. The first is comprised 

by those tidal datums calculated directly from field tidal heights
(field data from the installed maregraphs and indicated in the table as 
FD). 



The second category is made by the datums that were estimated using harmoni\
c 
constants (H) (which were also calculated from field tidal heights). 



Datums computed from harmonic constants estimate a tidal level which
is determined only by the gravitational effects of moon and sun. In other 
words, they do not take into account daily and seasonal changes in sea leve\
l 
or wind effects. In the other hand, the datums based on field data do take 
into account meteorological and sea-level changes effects. 



Hourly tidal data from September through December 93 was used in the
datum calculation for both sites. 


All figures are in meters.

the tide level relative to mean sea level. Note that there are
several sources of imprecision in this analysis. The GPS sea level
is on the VCR1 monument, which has elevation measured only to the
nearest 0.1 m. There is also some level of uncertainty added by the
GPS measurements between the VCR1 monument and the dock (in the
range of 2-5 cm). Finally, the HOG2 tide station is located on a
tidal creek which may drain completely at less than full low
tide.</para></section></section></description></methodStep></method></attribute><attribute id="VCR97053.WTEMP" scope="document"><attributeName>WTEMP</attributeName><attributeLabel>Water Temperature</attributeLabel><attributeDefinition>WTEMP - Water Temperature</attributeDefinition><storageType typeSystem="textFile">float</storageType><measurementScale><nominal><nonNumericDomain><textDomain><definition>Water Temperature</definition></textDomain></nonNumericDomain></nominal></measurementScale><missingValueCode><code>.</code><codeExplanation>missing</codeExplanation></missingValueCode><method><methodStep><description><section><para>Water temperature is only available for the Redbank tide station.</para></section></description></methodStep></method></attribute><attribute id="VCR97053.BAROM" scope="document"><attributeName>BAROM</attributeName><attributeLabel>Barometric Pressure (mm of mercury)</attributeLabel><attributeDefinition>BAROM - Barometric Pressure (mm of mercury)</attributeDefinition><storageType typeSystem="textFile">float</storageType><measurementScale><interval><unit><customUnit>mm</customUnit></unit><numericDomain><numberType>real</numberType></numericDomain></interval></measurementScale><missingValueCode><code>.</code><codeExplanation>missing</codeExplanation></missingValueCode><method><methodStep><description><section><para>Barometric pressure is only available for the HOGI and HOG2
