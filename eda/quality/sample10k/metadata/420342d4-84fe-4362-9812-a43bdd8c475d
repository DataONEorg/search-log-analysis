      <abstract>This part of DS 781 presents the seafloor-character map of Offshore of Monterey map area, California. The raster data file is included in "SeafloorCharacter_2m_OffshoreMonterey.zip," which is accessible from http://dx.doi.org/10.5066/F7F47M6T .
This raster-format seafloor-character map shows four substrate classes in the Offshore of Monterey map area, California. The substrate classes mapped in this area have been further divided into the following California Marine Life Protection Act depth zones and slope classes: Depth Zone 2 (intertidal to 30 m), Depth Zone 3 (30 to 100 m), Depth Zone 4 (100 to 200 m), Slope Class 1 (0 degrees - 5 degrees), and Slope Class 2 (5 degrees - 30 degrees). Depth Zone 1 (intertidal), Depth Zone 5 (greater than 200 m), and Slopes Classes 3-4 (greater than 30 degrees) are not present in this map area. The map is created using a supervised classification method described by Cochrane (2008), using multibeam echosounder (MBES) bathymetry and backscatter data collected and processed between 1998 and 2014.
Bathymetry data were collected at two different resolutions: at 2-m resolution, down to approximately 90-m water depth (1998-2012 CSUMB and MBARI data); and at 5-m resolution, in the deeper areas (1998-2012 MBARI data). The final resolution of the seafloor-character map is determined by the resolution of both the backscatter and bathymetry datasets; therefore, separate seafloor-character maps were generated to retain the maximum resolution of the source data.

        <procdesc>The seafloor-character map was produced using video-supervised maximum likelihood classification of the bathymetry and intensity of return from sonar systems. The classification was supervised using signatures defined by hand-drawn polygons located through sediment samples and video-observation ground truth surveying applying methodology described in Cochrane (2008), available at http://doc.nprb.org/web/research/research%20pubs/615_habitat_mapping_workshop/Individual%20Chapters%20High-Res/Ch13%20Cochrane.pdf.
The two variants used in this classification were backscatter intensity and derivative rugosity. Rugosity measures terrain ruggedness as the variation in three-dimensional orientation of grid cells within a neighborhood. Vector analysis is used to calculate the dispersion of vectors normal (orthogonal) to grid cells within the specified neighborhood. This method effectively captures variability in slope and aspect into a single measure. Ruggedness values in the output raster map can range from 0 (no terrain variation) to 1 (complete terrain variation). The calculation was performed using the Terrain Ruggedness (VRM) tool (for details, see Sappington and others, 2007). Bathymetry data were collected at two different resolutions: at 2-m resolution, down to approximately 90-m water depth (1998-2012 CSUMB and MBARI data); and at 5-m resolution, in the deeper areas (1998-2012 MBARI data). The final resolution of the seafloor-character map is determined by the resolution of both the backscatter and bathymetry datasets; therefore, separate seafloor-character maps were generated to retain the maximum resolution of the source data.
Classes I, II and III values were delineated using multivariate analysis. Class IV (mobile sedimentary features) values were determined on the basis of visual characteristics using both bathymetry and backscatter. The resulting map (gridded at 5 m) was cleaned by hand to remove data-collection artifacts (for example trackline nadir). Editing was performed in Photoshop, with which individual pixels were selected and values adjusted to remove noise.  Selection occurred without antialiasing, and the resulting grid was identical but for the edited pixels. The four seafloor classes were then colored to indicate which of the five California MLPA depth zones they are located in: Depth Zone 2 (intertidal to 30 m), Depth Zone 3 (30 to 100 m), Depth Zone 4 (100 to 200 m), or Depth Zone 5 (deeper than 200 m). These were further subdivided into one of the following slope classes: Slope Class 1 (0 degrees - 5 degrees; flat), or Slope Class 2 (5 degrees - 30 degrees; sloping). Depth Zone 1 (intertidal), Slope Class 3 (30 degrees to 60 degrees; steeply sloping), Slope Class 4 (60 degrees - 90 degrees; vertical), or Slope Class 5 (greater than 90 degrees; overhang) are not present in the region covered by the 5-m-resolution grid  for the Offshore of Monterey map area.</procdesc>

Derivative roughness (rugosity) and backscatter intensity were used as variants in the classification.

Depth Zone 2, add 0 to grid value; Depth Zone 3, add 10 to grid value; Depth Zone 4, add 20 to grid value; and Depth Zone 5, add 30 to grid value. The resulting grid was further classified into Slope Classes (see Attribute: SLOPE) by adding to the classified raster values (including depth zones) in increments of 50. Slope Class 1, add 0 to grid value; Slope Class 2, add 50 to grid value; Slope Class 3, add 100 to grid value; and Slope Class 4, add 150 to grid value.</attrdef>

    <techpreq>The downloadable data file has been compressed with the "zip" command and can be unzipped with Winzip (or other tool) on Windows systems. To utilize these data, the user must have software capable of uncompressing the WinZip file and importing and viewing an Esri ArcMap TIFF. Users should download the ArcGIS Project File, OffshoreMontereyGIS.mxd.zip, a compressed (with the "zip" command) version of the ArcMap document (.mxd) that has all the data layers loaded in the table of contents for "Offshore Monterey" and has all the data symbolized as on the data release map sheets. Download and save this ArcGIS project file, including all data layers, to the directory the user has created for this GIS.</techpreq>
