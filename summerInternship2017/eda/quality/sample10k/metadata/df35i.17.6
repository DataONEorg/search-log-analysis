 <abstract><para>Subsistence users from the remote Alaska Peninsula Native Village of Perryville had noted significant declines in the coho salmon run in the nearby Kametolook River since the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill (EVOS). The Trustee Council began funding a project in Federal Fiscal Year 1997 (October 1, 1996 - September 30, 1997) with the intent of restoring this coho salmon run. This project was a continuation of an evaluative phase of the project funded through the EVOS criminal settlement (Grant Agreement Number 21685881 May through September 1996). The criminal settlement funded the project for an assessment team from the Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADFG) and local assistants from the Native Village of Perryville. The assessment period determined the preferred method to restore the Kametolook River's coho salmon run to historic levels. This phase ended with the approval of an Environmental Assessment (EA) and a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) by the US Fish and Wildlife Service in May 1997. The EA and project review supported instream incubation boxes as the preferred restoration alternative.

Annually, every November 1997 through 2001, coho salmon eggs were placed in two Kametolook River instream incubation boxes to improve the green egg to fry survival over natural in-river conditions. Since, 1997, the Kametolook River coho escapement has shown some improvement. The later coho salmon escapement level can also be partially attributed to self-imposed in-river harvest restrictions by the villagers and commercial fishing restrictions in marine waters. Community involvement and use of local traditional ecological knowledge by the villagers of Perryville was also an integral part of the projects plan toward the restoration of Kametolook River coho salmon as a subsistence resource. Kametolook River coho escapement estimates didn't increase significantly over the six years of the project as hoped. This is due in part to the low number of annual returning adult coho salmon available for the egg takes and natural spawning.

In 1999, The Perryville Subsistence Workgroup was formed to address the subsistence needs of Perryville residents and has remained active throughout the remainder of this project. This group is currently seeking funding that will allow the egg box project to continue beyond September 2002. In addition, this group also hopes to obtain genetic and pathology samples of nearby coho systems (fish transport permit requirements) and the eventual transport of eggs from these systems to the Kametolook River egg boxes. This additional work should increase escapements in the Kametolook River and thus provide more eggs for the incubation boxes and eventually a surplus of adult coho salmon available for Perryville residents' subsistence fishing.

Also as part of the project, starting in 1996 a school aquarium project for the Perryville School was set up and maintained annually throughout all project years. Annually approximately 300 to 500 fertilized coho salmon eggs were placed in the Perryville school aquarium and students followed the development of the eggs to the swim up fry stage. The teachers developed lesson plans in biology and ecology around the aquarium project and developed a stewardship of the local salmon runs with the students.</para>

     <methods><methodStep><description><section><title>Initial assessment, May 1996</title>
 <para>Three Alaska Department of Fish and Game assessment team members and local Perryville residents assessed the Kametolook River in order to make recommendations for the best retoration efforts. A small instream test incubator plywood box (two square feet) was installed at the headwaters of the river. The incubator box was also equipped with a thermograph to aid in determining the potential of the incubation site. Thermographs were also installed at three other habitat-monitoring locations along the Kametolook River. Young-of-the-year and fingerling coho were observed in several slough habitats and small ponds. Preliminary investigations were also undertaken for possible stocking of rainbow trout or coho salmon into two landlocked lakes (Sandy and Sicken Lakes) in proximity to Perryville.</para>

 <methodStep><description><section><title>Preparation, October 1996</title>
 <para>Three Alaska Department of Fish and Game assessment team members and local assistants expanded the habitat surveys of drainages adjacent to Perryville, placed fertilized eggs in the experimental stream side incubation box, and initiated a cooperative educational program in the Perryville school.</para>
 <para>Minnow trapping was conducted in the Kametolook, Three Star, and Long Beach Rivers. Several high school students assisted with coho fingerling data collection efforts and explained the field trip experience to their fellow students. Plans were developed with the science teacher to install and permit a classroom aquarium incubator for coho salmon eggs.</para>
 <para>Genetic, kidney, otolith, and scale samples were taken from 32 collected coho salmon. All observed coho salmon appeared to be recent arrivals to the river and were not ripe; seeding fertilized coho eggs into the incubation box was not possible.</para>

 <methodStep><description><section><title>Coho salmon capture and spawning, November 1996</title>
 <para>Two Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADFG) assessment team members joined with local Perryville assistants to capture and spawn one pair of coho salmon for the incubation box in Kametolook River. Salmon were captured via gillnetting. Following standard delayed fertilization techniques, the eggs were fertilized and seeded into the incubation box. A thermograph was deployed in the substrate near the largest group of spawning salmon. A survey to enumerate spawning coho was conducted. The subsistence harvest continued, and the observed escapement might have been higher than the actual spawning escapement.</para>
 <para>At the high school, the ADFG team assembled the aquarium incubator. When the eggs reach the eyed stage, about 250 eggs from the stream side incubator were transfered to the classroom incubator (January ADFG field trip).</para>

 <methodStep><description><section><title>Coho salmon egg harvest and transfer to Perryville school aquarium, January 1997</title>
 <para>Two Alaska Department of Fish and Game team members and local Perryville assistants checked the thermograph and staff gauge sites, shocked the incubating eggs, discarded dead eggs, and sorted out about 250 eggs which were transported to the school aquarium. An approved Fish Transport Permit allowed 250 eggs to be raised in the school aquarium and the release back into the Kametolook River. With the assistance of five high school students, the team measured physical characteristics of two landlocked lakes as potential coho fry or rainbow trout release sites and collected gravel for alevin habitat in the aquarium.</para>

 <methodStep><description><section><title>Coho salmon egg harvests and fry release into the Kametolook River</title>
 <para>Cooperative agreements were drawn up annually each fall for the Native Village of Perryville who is partners with the Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADFG) on this project. In the falls of 1996 through 2000, weekly stream surveys were conducted by local Perryville residents, and written and verbal reports were provided to ADFG personal. When coho salmon started to appear in the upper reaches of the Kametolook River (late October or early November), ADFG conducted additional stream surveys. Small mesh gill nets were used to capture adult coho salmon in the portion of the Kametolook River where spawning/ ripening occurs. These salmon were quickly separated by gender and placed into holding pens in the Kametolook River until ripe for harvesting (genetic integrity of the Kametolook River coho salmon was assured under the guidance of ADFG's Principal Geneticist and identified on the appropriate obtained permits). During this time, the two large production egg boxes were cleaned and prepared for the egg installation approximately two weeks later. In 1997, the egg incubation boxes were installed near a spring approximately eight miles upstream from the mouth of the Kametolook River. Approximately two weeks later (mid November) salmon were ripe and ready for harvest. The coho eggs were harvested, fertilized with milt, and then placed into the egg boxes. A small quantity of fertilized eggs was also transported to the Perryville school aquarium. Kidney, ovarian (for pathological testing), and fin (for genetic testing) samples continued to be collected from coho used for the harvest and given to the ADFG and the US Fish and Wildlife Service for pathological and genetic analysis.</para>
 <para>The egg boxes were monitored throughout the winter and spring and reports were provided. Fry from these boxes were produced in 1999/2000 and 2000/2001 from the fall egg harvests and they were naturally released into the Kametolook River in the spring/ early summer of the following years.</para>
