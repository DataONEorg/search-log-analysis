      <abstract>This product is a digital elevation model (DEM) for the Little Holland Tract in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta, California based on U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)-collected elevation data, merged with existing topographic and bathymetric elevation data. The USGS collected topographic and bathymetric elevation data in 2015, using a combination of methods. Topographic and shallow-water bathymetric data were collected on foot using a global positioning system (GPS) backpack platform that consisted of survey-grade Trimble R10, and Trimble R7 global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receivers with Zephyr 2 antennas. Bathymetric data were collected using a personal watercraft (PWC) platform that consisted of Trimble R7 GNSS receivers with Zephyr 2 antennas, combined with Odom Echotrac CV-100 single-beam echosounders and 200 kHz transducers. The USGS elevation data were merged with topographic aerial Light Detection and Ranging (lidar) data collected by California Department of Water Resources (DWR) in 2007 and single-beam bathymetric data collected by Environmental Data Solutions (EDS) in 2009 to generate the final DEM. The GeoTIFF raster and comma-delimited text files are available for download at http://dx.doi.org/10.5066/F7RX9954.</abstract>
      <purpose>These data are intended for science researchers, students, policy makers, and the general public. These data can be used with geographic information systems or other software to identify topographic and bathymetric features.</purpose>

    <posacc>
      <horizpa>
        <horizpar>The Digital Elevation Model (DEM) was created by interpolating between measurements as much as 100 meters apart, for this reason we cannot evaluate the accuracy of each point in the DEM, only the measurements it is based on. The lidar collected by California Department of Water Resources stated a horizontal accuracy of 1 meter. The bathymetric data collected by Environmental Data Solutions (2009) did not report horizontal accuracy. Accuracy estimates for the PWC survey platforms were estimated by computing the standard deviations of the GNSS rover positions relative to the static base station using Waypoint Grafnav (version 5.0). Based on these calculations, the mean horizontal accuracy of GNSS positions at the 95 percent confidence interval (1.96 times the standard deviations assuming a normal distribution) is 3.5 cm.
Accuracy estimates for the GPS Backpack survey platforms were based on horizontal precision values calculated in Trimble Business Center. Horizontal precision values for each point are included in the dataset, but overall the minimum, maximum, mean and standard deviation precision calculations were 0.009, 0.103, 0.0239, and 0.006 meters, respectively.</horizpar>

        <vertaccr>The Digital Elevation Model (DEM) was created by interpolating between measurements as much as 100 meters apart, for this reason we cannot evaluate the accuracy of each point in the DEM, only the measurements it is based on. The lidar collected by California Department of Water Resources stated a vertical accuracy of 18.5 cm. The bathymetric data collected by Environmental Data Solutions (2009) did not report a vertical accuracy. Accuracy estimates for the PWC survey platforms were estimated by computing the standard deviations of the GNSS rover positions relative to the static base station using Waypoint Grafnav (version 5.0). Based on these calculations, the mean vertical accuracy of GNSS positions at the 95 percent confidence interval (1.96 times the standard deviations assuming a normal distribution) were calculated. Depths measured using sonar are subject to additional sources of uncertainty including fluctuations in the speed of sound and from the pitch and roll of the survey vessels. Given the relatively calm water surface and low range of water depth present in this survey, we estimate depth sounding uncertainty to be 1 percent of the water depth. The mean estimated vertical uncertainty is 6.1 cm.
Accuracy estimates for the GPS Backpack survey platforms were based on vertical precision values calculated in Trimble Business Center. Vertical precision values for each point are included in the dataset, but overall the minimum, maximum, mean and standard deviation precision calculations were 0.194, 0.014, 0.0351, and 0.011 meters, respectively.</vertaccr>

      <procstep>
        <procdesc>The elevation data collected by the USGS during this survey were combined with existing data to generate a digital elevation model (DEM). Additional data sources were used to model the topography of the exposed areas of Little Holland Tract and the bathymetry of the surrounding channels. Topographic aerial Light Detection and Ranging (lidar) data (DWR, 2009) were used to generate the DEM in the areas where land is exposed. The lidar dataset required some processing, which included removing returns from water and vegetation. The effect of vegetation was reduced by using the minimum elevation in a 2-meter grid space. Additionally, bathymetric data from 2009 (EDS, 2009) were used to estimate the bathymetry of the channels surrounding Little Holland Tract, and the shoreline was digitized using an aerial photo (NOAA, 2012). The elevation of this shoreline was estimated by averaging the elevation values collected using backpack GPS systems in areas where the survey was spatially coincident with the digital shoreline. Combining the three datasets, USGS 2015 elevation data, DWR 2007 LiDAR, and CBEC 2009 bathymetry, a triangular irregular network (TIN) was generated using ArcMap 10.2.2, using the digitized shoreline as a hard breakline. The TIN was then converted to a grid with 1-meter resolution.</procdesc>
