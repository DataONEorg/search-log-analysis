      <abstract>This digital data set consists of saturated thickness contours for
the High Plains aquifer in Central United States, 1996-97.  The
High Plains aquifer extends from south of 32 degrees to almost 44
degrees north latitude and from 96 degrees 30 minutes to 104 degrees
west longitude.  The aquifer underlies about 174,000 square miles in parts of
Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, New Mexico, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas,
and Wyoming.

This data set was based on 10,085 water-level measurements, 49 stream
elevations, (March 1997) and 10,036 water-level elevations from wells
(1,370 from 1996 and 8,666 from 1997) and the base of aquifer value
for each measurement location. The saturated thickness at each measurement
location was determined by subtracting the water-level elevation from
the base of aquifer at that location.
			</abstract>
      <purpose>This data set was created to document the original map (McGuire and
Fischer, 1999) produced by the High Plains Water-level Monitoring
project and make available the data on this map for use with
geographic information systems.  

This map is published in the web report "Water-level changes, 1980 to 1997, and saturated thickness, 1996-97, in the High Plains aquifer" and USGS Fact Sheet 124-99, "Water-level changes, 1980 to 1997, and saturated thickness, 1996-97, in the High Plains aquifer".

      <supplinf>Introduction --

The information provided in this introduction is found in U.S. Geological
Survey Professional Paper 1400-B (Gutentag and others, 1984).  This
data set consists of saturated thickness contours for the High Plains
aquifer in Central United States, 1996-97 (modified from Weeks and Gutentag, 1981;
Cederstrand and Becker, 1999).  The High Plains aquifer, which underlies about
174,000 square miles in parts of eight states, is the principal water source in one
of the nation's major agricultural areas.  In 1980, about 170,000 wells pumped
water from the aquifer to irrigate about 13 million acres.

The High Plains aquifer is a regional water-table aquifer consisting
mostly of near-surface sand and gravel deposits.  In 1980, the maximum
saturated thickness of the aquifer was about 1,000 feet and averaged
about 200 feet.  Hydraulic conductivity and specific yield of the aquifer
depend on sediment types, which vary significantly both horizontally and
vertically. Hydraulic conductivity ranged from less than 25 to greater
than 300 feet per day and averaged 60 feet per day.  Specific yields
ranged from less than 10 to 30 percent and averaged about 15 percent.

The High Plains aquifer boundaries were determined by erosional extent
of associated geologic units and by hydraulic and physiographic boundaries
where the High Plains aquifer extends eastward from the Great Plains
physiographic province (Fenneman, 1931).  In most of the area, the erosional
extent of the hydraulically connected Tertiary and Quaternary deposits were
used as the aquifer boundary.  In eastern Nebraska, streams and physiographic
boundaries were used as the aquifer boundary.

Reviews Applied to Data --

This electronic report was subjected to the same review standard that
applies to all U.S. Geological Survey reports.  Reviewers were asked to
check the topological consistency, tolerances, attribute frequencies and
statistics, projection, and geographic extent.  Reviewers were given
digital data sets for checking against the source maps to verify the
linework and attributes.  The reviewers checked the metadata files for
completeness and accuracy.

        <procdesc>Selected wells screened in the High Plains aquifer that were
measured in preirrigation season 1996 or 1997 and had land
surface elevation determined.  Selected the 1997 water-level
elevation, if available, or the 1996 water-level elevation if
the 1997 water-level is not available.  Calculated water-level
elevation for each well in the coverage, WL_PTS_ALL.

ARC/INFO software and commands then were used to
create the coverage.  ARC/INFO commands are shown below
in capitals.

Step 1. Appended the available March 1997 stream-level
elevations for northeastern Colorado, northwestern Kansas, and
Nebraska to the WL_PTS_ALL coverage.

Step 2. Used TOPOGRID to make a grid of the aquifer base using the High Plains
Regional Aquifer System Analysis map (Weeks and Gutentag, 1981; Cederstrand
and Becker, 1999). The grid has a cell size of  500 meters.  The base of aquifer
map has 200-foot contours.  The scale of the base of aquifer map is 1 to 1,000,000
(Cederstrand and Becker, 1999).

Step 3. Clipped aquifer base grid to the aquifer boundary
using LATTICECLIP command.

        <procdate>19981012</procdate>
      </procstep>
      <procstep>
        <procdesc>Step 4. Used LATTICESPOT to calculate aquifer base value for
each well with water-level elevation in 1996-97 and stored in
the coverage WL_PTS_ALL.

Step 5. Added an item, using ADDITEM command, for saturated
thickness for each well with water-level elevation in 1996-97,
calculated saturated thickness for each well, and stored in
cover WL_PTS_ALL.

        <procdate>19981015</procdate>
      </procstep>
      <procstep>
        <procdesc>Step 6. Used TOPOGRID to make a grid of the water table from
well with water-level elevation in 1996-97 and March 1997
stream-elevations.  Renamed the water-table, wt_grd.

Step 7. Copied the aquifer base using the COPY command.  Used
TOPOGRID to create the grid aquifer base, aqbase_grd.
				</procdesc>
        <procdate>19981016</procdate>
      </procstep>
      <procstep>
        <procdesc>Step 8. Created the grid saturated thickness, SAT_WL_GRD,  by
calculating, SAT_WL_GRD = wt_grd - aqbase_grd.

Step 9. Clipped the saturated thickness grid to the aquifer
boundary.  SAT_WL_GRD2 = SELECTPOLYGON(SAT_WL_GRD).

Step 10. Sliced the saturated thickness grid by contour
intervals.  SLICE_SAT = SLICE (SAT_WL_GRD2, table, slice,
value, value)

Step 11. Changed the saturated thickness grid into an integer
grid using, temp = INT (slice_sat), BUILDVAT temp, RENAME temp
sat_thick_fin, RENAME sat_thick_fin sat_wl_grd commands.

Step 12. Printed the saturated thickness grid (sat_wl_grd) and
point values of saturated thickness (wl_pts_all) on mylar,
manually modified the contours to agree with the point values
or with previously published maps where current point values
are not available.  The final coverage of saturated thickness
contours is called sat_thick_dig.

    <overview>
      <eaover>Each polygon in this data set has an associated attribute of
RANGE containing ranges of saturated thickness expressed in
feet or an identification of "island" noting an area within the
main aquifer boundary where the aquifer is not present.

There is a polygon attribute table associated with this file:

SATTK_97.PAT:
