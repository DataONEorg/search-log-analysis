      <abstract>This spatial data layer is a cell-based Raster model characterizing the contribution of phosphorus (P) to streams from weathering and erosion of surficial geologic materials for the conterminous United States, and has been created as part of the SPARROW (Spatially Referenced Regressions on Watershed Attributes) water-quality model implementation. SPARROW provides estimates of total nitrogen and phosphorus load in surface waters from point and non-point sources. This data set represents only potential for P contributions, and does not include N. The characterization of contribution of P from geologic materials will help separate the effects of natural or background sources from anthropogenic sources of P, such as from municipal wastewater or agricultural practices. The potential of a watershed to contribute P from naturally occurring geologic materials in the watershed to the adjacent receiving stream is characterized using geochemical data from bed-sediment samples (USGS National Geochemical Survey, National Uranium Resource Evaluation (NURE), Smith 1979) collected from first-order streams in relatively undisturbed watersheds.  Bed sediment samples were collected from 1975 through 1980. The bed-sediment phosphorus concentrations (BSPconc) in this data set represent BSPconc in the absence of anthropogenic sources and therefore spatial variation in BSPconc can be used to indicate spatial variation in the potential to contribute naturally occurring P from the geologic materials in the watershed to the stream. A continuous mapped distribution of BSPconc in headwater streams for the conterminous U.S. was prepared by summarizing BSPconc from 50,740 bed-sediment samples by geologic unit using regional-scale geologic map units (GMU's). The GMU's delineate areas with similar lithochemistry based on geologic age as well as ecoregion units. GMU’s were created by combining surficial geology (Hunt, Charles D., 1979) with Level IV Ecoregion units (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 2011). This data set represents the mean BSPconc value for each GMU. The spatial pattern of BSPconc in headwater streams is offered as a data layer, representing best available information at the regional scale, with the caveat that its performance as a surrogate for contribution of P from watershed geologic materials to in-stream levels of P is weakened by not accounting for variability across headwater streams in the rates of net deposition and processing of P in the streambed.</abstract>
      <purpose>This data set was created to provide an estimate of contributions of phosphorus contributions to streams by naturally occurring surficial geology. It is intended to be used with the SPARROW model.</purpose>

        <srccitea>Level IV Ecoregions of the Conterminous United States</srccitea>
        <srccontr>Ecoregions denote areas of general similarity in ecosystems and in the type, quality, and quantity of environmental resources. They are designed to serve as a spatial framework for the research, assessment, management, and monitoring of ecosystems and ecosystem components. These general purpose regions are critical for structuring and implementing ecosystem management strategies across federal agencies, state agencies, and nongovernment organizations that are responsible for different types of resources within the same geographical areas. The approach used to compile this map is based on the premise that ecological regions can be identified through the analysis of patterns of biotic and abiotic phenomena, including geology, physiography, vegetation, climate, soils, land use, wildlife, and hydrology. The relative importance of each characteristic varies from one ecological region to another. A Roman numeral hierarchical scheme has been adopted for different levels for ecological regions. Level I is the coarsest level, dividing North America into 15 ecological regions. Level II divides the continent into 50 regions (Commission for Environmental Cooperation Working Group, 1997). At Level III, the continental United States contains 104 regions whereas the conterminous United States has 85 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2005). Level IV ecoregions are further subdivisions of Level III ecoregions.  The ecoregions data used are published at a scale of 1:250,000.</srccontr>

        <srccontr>Phosphorus stream bed sediment data as collected by USGS NURE: The USGS, in collaboration with other federal and state government agencies, industry, and academia, is conducting the National Geochemical Survey (NGS) to produce a body of geochemical data for the United States based primarily on stream sediments, analyzed using a consistent set of methods. These data will compose a complete, national-scale geochemical coverage of the United States, and will enable construction of geochemical maps, refine estimates of baseline concentrations of chemical elements in the sampled media, and provide context for a wide variety of studies in the geological and environmental sciences. The goal of the NGS is to analyze at least one stream-sediment sample in every 289 square kilometer area by a single set of analytical methods across the entire nation, with other solid sample media substituted where necessary. The NGS incorporates geochemical data from a variety of sources, including existing analyses in USGS databases, reanalysis of samples in USGS archives, and analyses of newly collected samples. At the present time, the NGS includes data covering approximately 71% of the land area of the U.S., including samples in all 50 states. This version of the online report provides complete access to NGS data, describes the history of the project, the methodology used, and presents preliminary geochemical maps for all analyzed elements. Future editions of this and other related reports will include the results of analysis of variance studies, as well as interpretive products related to the NGS data. This database provides in digital form many geochemical analyses reported by USGS in its published literature.</srccontr>
