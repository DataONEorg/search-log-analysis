The 500 x 350 m study area (17.5 ha) consisted of a grid of 8 rows of stakes in an east/west direction and 11 rows of stakes  in a north/south direction (for a total of 88 stakes). The stakes  were located 50 m apart. Each stake was given a point identification  number starting with 1 in the southwest corner and progressing in an  easterly direction for each of the east/west rows so that if head of this file represented the north compass point and the tail represented the south compass point, then the grid would look like this: 71   72   73   74   75   76   77   78   79   80   801(=80A) 61   62   63   64   65   66   67   68   69   70   701(=70A) 51   52   53   54   55   56   57   58   59   60   601(=60A) 41   42   43   44   45   46   47   48   49   50   501(=50A) 31   32   33   34   35   36   37   38   39   40   401(=40A) 21   22   23   24   25   26   27   28   29   30   301(=30A) 11   12   13   14   15   16   17   18   19   20   201(=20A)  1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8    9   10   101(=10A) Note that stakes along the east boundary of the grid, i.e. those  ending with the &quot;A&quot;, were given new designations in order to  facilitate incorportation of the data into the Saddle GIS. Snow depths at each of the stakes were recorded on a weekly to biweekly basis throughout the period during which snow accumu- lation existed on the Saddle.</para></abstract><keywordSet><keyword>NWT</keyword><keyword>Niwot Ridge LTER Site</keyword><keyword>LTER</keyword><keyword>Colorado</keyword><keyword>GIS</keyword><keyword>Saddle grid</keyword><keyword>snow</keyword><keyword>snow accumulation</keyword><keyword>snow depth</keyword><keyword>snowmelt</keyword><keyword>snowpack</keyword></keywordSet><distribution scope="document"><online><url function="download">http://culter.colorado.edu/exec/.extracttoolA?saddsnow.dw</url></online></distribution><coverage scope="document"><temporalCoverage scope="document"><rangeOfDates><beginDate><calendarDate>1992-10-30</calendarDate></beginDate><endDate><calendarDate>2008-12-30</calendarDate></endDate></rangeOfDates></temporalCoverage><geographicCoverage scope="document"><geographicDescription></geographicDescription><boundingCoordinates><westBoundingCoordinate>-105.643</westBoundingCoordinate><eastBoundingCoordinate>-105.3753</eastBoundingCoordinate><northBoundingCoordinate>40.0615</northBoundingCoordinate><southBoundingCoordinate>39.9932</southBoundingCoordinate></boundingCoordinates></geographicCoverage></coverage><maintenance><description><para>The documentation for this file was created by Susan Kindig in May of 1993, with additional information being supplied by Rick Ingersoll and Brad Lewis.
