      <abstract>In June and August of 1992, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) conducted geophysical surveys to investigate the shallow geologic framework from Lake Pontchartrain, Louisiana, to Mobile Bay, Alabama. This work was conducted onboard the Argonne National Laboratorys R/V ERDA-1 as part of the Mississippi/Alabama Pollution Project. This report is part of a series to digitally archive the legacy analog data collected from the Mississippi-Alabama SHelf (MASH). The MASH data rescue project is a cooperative effort by the USGS and the Minerals Management Service (MMS). This report serves as an archive of high resolution scanned Tagged Image File Format (TIFF) and Graphics Interchange Format (GIF) images of the original boomer paper records, navigation files, trackline maps, Geographic Information System (GIS) files, cruise logs, and formal Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC) metadata.

For more information on the seismic surveys see http://woodshole.er.usgs.gov/operations/ia/public_ds_info.php?fa=1992-010-FA and http://woodshole.er.usgs.gov/operations/ia/public_ds_info.php?fa=1992-037-FA

These data are also available via GeoMapApp (http://www.geomapapp.org/) and Virtual Ocean ( http://www.virtualocean.org/) earth science exploration and visualization applications.</abstract>
      <purpose>The data archived here were collected as part of the Mississippi/Alabama Pollution Project.</purpose>
      <supplinf>A standardized naming convention was established to allow for better management of scanned trackline images within the MASH data rescue project. Each cruise received a unique field activity ID based on the year the data were collected, the first two digits of the survey vessel name, and the number of cruises made (to date) by that vessel that year (i.e. 92ER2 represents the second cruise made by the R/V ERDA-1 in 1992.) The new field activity IDs 92ER2 and 92ER4 presented in this report were originally referred to as ERDA 92-2 and ERDA 92-4 at the USGS in St. Petersburg, FL, and 92010 and 92037 at the USGS in Woods Hole, MA. A table showing the naming convention lineage for cruise IDs in the MASH data rescue series is included as a PDF. This report serves as an archive of high resolution scanned Tagged Image File Format (TIFF) and Graphics Interchange Format (GIF) images of the original boomer paper records, navigation files, trackline maps, Geographic Information System (GIS) files, cruise logs, and formal Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC) metadata for cruises 92ER2 and 92ER4.  The boomer system uses an acoustic energy source called a plate, which consists of capacitors charged to a high voltage and discharged through a transducer in the water. The source is towed on a sled, at sea level, and when discharged emits a short acoustic pulse, or shot, which propagates through the water and sediment column. The acoustic energy is reflected at density boundaries (such as the seafloor or sediment layers beneath the seafloor), detected by the hydrophone receiver, and the amplitude of the reflected energy is recorded by an Edward P. Curley Lab (EPC) thermal plotter. This process is repeated at timed intervals (for example, 0.5 s) and recorded for specific intervals of time (for example, 100 ms). The timed intervals are also referred to as the shot interval or fire rate. On analog records, the recorded interval is referred to as the sweep, which is the amount of time the recorder stylus takes to sweep from the top of the record to the bottom of the record, thereby recording the amplitude of the reflected energy of one shot. In this way, consecutive recorded shots produce a two-dimensional (2-D) vertical image of the shallow geologic structure beneath the ship track.</supplinf>

    <attracc>
      <attraccr>The validity or accuracy of marine seismic reflection profiles is highly qualitative and depends on equipment and operating condition variables. Visual inspection of the images rendered from the data did not show any major anomalies. All scanned images contain handwritten and plotter-generated annotations.</attraccr>
    </attracc>
    <logic>This data set is from two cruises with consistent instrument calibrations.</logic>
    <complete>These data are collected along tracklines (2-D) and are therefore inherently incomplete. Geologic details between lines must be inferred.</complete>
    <posacc>
      <horizpa>
        <horizpar>As the seismic reflection data were acquired, the position of the vessel was recorded using GPS and LOng RAnge Navigation (LORAN)-C systems; a description of the navigation acquistion system (1,445-KB PDF) has been provided in the RAW sub-folder located within the NAVIGATION folder. The accuracy of the LORAN-C varied from 528 to 1320 ft, with repeatable accuracy between 60 and 300 ft (http://www.navcen.uscg.gov/loran/handbook/h-book.htm.)  Positions were recorded in latitude and longitude coordinates every 5 min and appear on the seismic profiles as incremental, hand-annotated vertical event marks. Navigation data were obtained as DAT files, opened using Notepad, and saved as tab-deliminated text files.</horizpar>
      </horizpa>
      <vertacc>
        <vertaccr>Boomer data are relative to sea level. However, varying recorded static shifts of the data have been known to occur. Therefore, these data are not to be used for bathymetry.</vertaccr>

        <procdesc>Analog data processing: Paper records were scanned at 200 dpi using an IDEAL/Contex Crystal TX 40" (1394) large-format scanner and converted to TIFF format using WIDEimage software (version 2.8.1) in the black and white adaptive mode. Whole roll TIFF images of multiple lines were manually cropped into individual survey lines using WIDEimage. Line images longer than 30,000 pixels were separated into smaller segments for editing with Adobe Photoshop CS2 where a metadata header file was appended to each survey line or line segment. Images of individual survey lines were named by combining the MASH cruise ID with the survey line (or trackline) number using an underscore, for example, 92ER2_1. If survey lines were longer than 30,000 pixels the split segments were identified by appending a letter in alphabetical order to the line name, for example 92ER2_1(a). The metadata header file appended to each line or line segment was created in Adobe Illustrator CS2. These header-merged images were then converted to grayscale, flattened, and saved as TIFFs with lossless (LZW) image compression. To facilitate easy viewing or printing of the scanned profiles on any computing platform using Web browser software, TIFF images were scaled to 25% (with constrained proportions and bicubic resampling) in Photoshop and saved as GIF images.</procdesc>

        <procdesc>Navigation processing:  Raw shotpoint navigation data were formatted for use with ESRI ArcGIS 9.2 software and projected in WGS84 to visually inspect shotpoint accuracy. Point locations were checked against written notes made on the paper records and in the cruise logbooks. Any errors were identified, reviewed, and rectified. Hour and minute values were not altered from the format in the original data files. Attribute information was updated to include the USGS-Woods Hole field activity ID and the new USGS-St. Petersburg MASH cruise ID, and to identify if the survey had been continuous or split into legs.</procdesc>

        <procdesc>Trackline map creation: Three point-shapefile layers were created: all navigation shots (92ER2 and 92ER4_POINTS.shp), start-of-line shots (92ER2 and 92ER4_FIRST.shp), and start-of-segment shots (92ER2 and 92ER4_SEGMENT.shp). A trackline shapefile (92ER2 and 92ER4_LINES.shp) was generated from the POINTS.shp file using the 'locations to paths' function in Hawth's Analysis Tools (free for download at www.spatialecology.com). It should be noted that the ship's track between points is assumed to be a straight line. The attributes table of the LINES.shp file was manually updated with information for CRUISE and LEG. The trackline maps provided in this archive were created using ESRI ArcGIS 9.2 software and then exported to Adobe Illustrator CS2 for further editing. See the readme.txt file in the ARC folder for more details. The maps were later converted into JPEG format by Adobe GoLive. The Gulf States shoreline polygon was derived from a 1:70,000 vector coastline map of the United States originated by NOAA, 1994. The bathymetry line layer, with 100-meter contours supplemented by 20-meter contours on the continental shelf, was originated by NOAA, date unknown. The USGS is the originator of all other layers used. These images can be accessed through the links provided below or from within the CRUISENAV folder.</procdesc>
