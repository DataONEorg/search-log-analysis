      <supplinf>Introduction --

This data set consists of digital polygons of a constant
recharge value for the alluvial and terrace deposits along the
North Canadian River from Oklahoma City to Eufaula Lake in
east-central Oklahoma. Ground water in 710 square miles of
Quaternary-age alluvial and terrace deposits along the North
Canadian River is an important source of water for irrigation,
industrial, municipal, stock, and domestic supplies. The
aquifer, composed of alluvial and terrace deposits, consists of
sand, silt, clay, and gravel. The aquifer is underlain and in
hydraulic connection with the upper zone of the Permian-age
Garber-Wellington aquifer and the Pennsylvanian-age Ada-Vamoosa
aquifer. Other Permian and Pennsylvanian-age rocks underlying
the alluvial and terrace deposits have low permeabilities and
are not in hydraulic connection with the alluvial and terrace
aquifer (Havens, 1989).

The constant recharge value and some of the polygon boundaries
are from a ground-water modeling report published by the U.S.
Geological Survey, "Geohydrology of the alluvial and terrace
deposits of the North Canadian River from Oklahoma City to
Eufaula Lake, central Oklahoma," by Havens (1989, p. 22 and pl.
6). Some lines representing polygon boundaries were extracted
from digital surficial geology data sets by Cederstrand (1996a,
1996b) based on a scale of 1:250,000. The model-grid boundaries
were digitized from a paper-base map published at a scale of
1:250,000 (Havens, 1989, plate 6).

Recharge to the aquifer was estimated by Havens (1989, p.22) to
range from 1.7 inches per year  in the west to 7.0 inches per
year  in the east, with an average of 3.3 inches per year. The
recharge values used as input to the ground-water flow model
were not published in Havens (1989) and were not available from
any other source. Therefore, the alluvial and terrace deposits
were assigned the average recharge value of 3.3 inches per year
in this data set. Digital Line Graph (DLG) format requires
numbers to be stored as integers. Therefore, the recharge in
inches per year was multiplied by 100 and stored in the digital
data sets as hundredths of inches per year. For example 3.3
inches per year was multiplied by 100 and stored in the digital
data sets as 330 in hundredths of an inch per year.

Permian outcrops and parts of the aquifer that were not
included in the ground-water model were given a value -99999
to indicate the recharge is not known. Havens (1989) used a
grid size of 2 square miles in the ground-water flow model of
the alluvial and terrace deposits.

Ground-water flow models are numerical representations that
simplify and aggregate natural systems. Models are not unique;
different combinations of aquifer characteristics may produce
similar results. The hydraulic conductivity and recharge are
closely interrelated. As long as these two model inputs are
in balance the model has a small mean residual; it represents
the natural system numerically. If the hydraulic conductivity is
accurately known, the model can be used to accurately determine
recharge. Likewise, if the hydraulic conductivity is poorly
known, then the recharge will be poorly determined.

Therefore, values of recharge used in the model and presented
in this data set are not precise, but are within a reasonable
range when compared to independently collected data. Recharge
probably varies considerably over the local area, and model
recharge is at best an average over an area at least as large
as the model grid (and probably much larger than a single
cell).

Reviews Applied to Data --

This electronic report was subjected to the same review standard
that applies to all U.S. Geological Survey reports. Reviewers
were asked to check the topological consistency, tolerances,
attribute frequencies and statistics, projection, and geographic
extent. Reviewers were given digital data sets and paper plots
for checking against the source maps to verify the linework and
attributes. The reviewers checked the metadata and a_readme.1st
files for completeness and accuracy.

Related Spatial and Tabular Data Sets --

This data set is one of four digital map data sets being published
together for this aquifer. The four data sets are:

&gt;              aqbound -  aquifer boundaries

&gt;              cond    -  hydraulic conductivity

&gt;              recharg -  aquifer recharge

&gt;              wlelev  -  water-level elevation contours

Digital map data sets of the Oklahoma surficial geology digitized from
1:250,000-scale maps (or 1:125,000-scale maps for the three Oklahoma
panhandle counties) are published separately.

    <useconst>Lines representing aquifer boundaries, and therefore recharge
boundaries, were extracted from digital geology data sets by
Cederstrand (1996a, 1996b) based on a scale of 1:250,000. Some
of the model-grid boundaries (Havens, 1989, plate 6) were
digitized from a paper-base map with a maximum registration
root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.0135 map inches (0.0053
map centimeters). Recharge polygons represented at this scale
are indicative of broad, regional trends and should not be
interpreted as site-specific.

Ground-water flow models are numerical representations that
simplify and aggregate natural systems. Models are not unique;
different combinations of aquifer characteristics may produce
similar results. The hydraulic conductivity and recharge are
closely interrelated. As long as these two model inputs are
in balance the model has a small mean residual; it represents the
natural system numerically. If the hydraulic conductivity is
accurately known, the model can be used to accurately determine
recharge. Likewise, if the hydraulic conductivity is poorly
known, then the recharge will be poorly determined.

Therefore, values of recharge used in the model and presented
in this data set are not precise, but are within a reasonable
range when compared to independently collected data. Recharge
probably varies considerably over the local area, and model
recharge is at best an average over an area at least as large
as the model grid (and probably much larger than a single

    <overview>
      <eaover>Each polygon in this data set has an associated attribute, R,
that contains a recharge value (Havens, 1989) expressed in
hundredths of an inch per year. The recharge value of 3.3
inches per year is stored as an R value of 330 hundredths of
an inch per year. Polygons in this data set that contain a R
of -99999 represent areas where the recharge rate is not
known. R is stored in the first major code (MAJOR1) and 0 is
stored in the first minor code (MINOR1) for polygons in the
Digital Line Graph (DLG) version of this data set.

Each line in this digital data set has an associated
attribute, LSOURCE, that contains a code to indicate the source
of the line. A LSOURCE code of 1 indicates the line is from
Havens (1989) and a LSOURCE code of 2 indicates the line was
extracted from Cederstrand (1996a, 1996b). LSOURCE is stored
in the first major code (MAJOR1) for lines, and 0 is stored in
the first minor code (MINOR1) in the Digital Line Graph (DLG)
version of this data set.
