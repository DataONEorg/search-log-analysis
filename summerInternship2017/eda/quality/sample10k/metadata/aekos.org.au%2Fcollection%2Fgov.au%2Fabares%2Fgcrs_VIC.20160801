        <abstract>The Ground Cover Reference Sites Database of Victoria has been collected by Department of Primary Industries, Victoria as part of the Ground Cover Monitoring for Australia project. The data is being used to calibrate, validate and improve vegetation fractional cover products derived from remote sensing, in particular the satellite sensors MODIS and Landsat. The data is being used to improve the national fractional vegetation cover product of Guerschman et al. (2009) derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). This algorithm enables national, monthly identification of ground cover separating the photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic components by applying a linear unmixing methodology for spectral reflectance every 8 days as 16-day composites. For confidence in its ground cover estimates, the results were verified in the field at selected sites across Australia to allow more extensive calibration, validation and verification of accuracy of the remote sensing method. The Ground Cover Reference Sites Database represents the results of the field validation of remotely determined cover measurements by observing cover along point intersects with a total of 300 points (or 200 points with crops). It also has additional observations and measures such as landscape features, fire evidence, erosion evidence, biotic disturbance evidence, biomass estimates, basal area measurements, soil features and dominant vegetation species, as well as site photographs. The Ground Cover Reference Sites Database focuses on sites in extensive grazing systems of the rangelands and, to a lesser extent, in the mixed farming or intensive land use zone. Field validation aims at obtaining a wide spatial coverage of sites, with limited site revisits for temporal coverage.

                <description>Study location selection method: The study location selection method is used to identify and choose study locations for field validation of MODIS-derived fractional ground cover. The field site selection is done by the partner organisation in each state, which collect the field data. The criteria for selecting field sites across all states were first defined for the 2010-11 field campaign, with stratification based on soil colour, agricultural land use, and non-treed areas and open woodlands. For the 2011-12 campaign, the selection criteria were reviewed to include even distribution of sites across all cover levels (particularly very bare areas), inclusion of areas where fractional cover couldn't be calculated , areas with low spatial variability where ground cover patterns inside the transects also represent the surrounding area, a range of soil colours, areas without excess surface moisture, and a range of vegetation phenologies achieved by stratifying by IBRA region.; Study Location Visit Method: The study location visit method is carried out when visiting  a study location in order to assess the  physical and vegetation features of the site. Within the selected location the observers choose a homogeneous area of one hectare to accommodate the sampling unit. A modified discrete point sampling method is used to measure ground cover, three 100 m long line transects are set up in the shape of a star, with neighbouring transect forming angles of 60&amp;#176;. The three transects are orientated at 0&amp;#176; (north-south) 60&amp;#176; and 120&amp;#176;. They intersect at their respective 50 m marks, giving the centre of the sampling unit. In cropped environments only two transects are established both forming 45&amp;#176; angles with the crop rows and intersecting at their respective 50 m marks. In addition, information is collected on the current land use, plant growth phase, and management phase. Within the selected location the observers choose a homogeneous area of one hectare to accommodate the sampling unit. A modified discrete point sampling method is used to measure ground cover, three 100 m long line transects are set up in the shape of a star, with neighbouring transect forming angles of 60&amp;#176;.

In cropped environments only two transects are established both forming 45&amp;#176; angles with the crop rows and intersecting at their respective 50 m marks. In addition, information is collected on the current land use, plant growth phase, and management phase.; Study Location Photo Method: The study location photo method provides photographs as a visual record of fractional ground cover at the field site. Seven photos are taken at each site in natural or pastoral environments. For vegetation in rows (cropping), five photos are taken. The first photo is taken at breast height (1.3 metres) directly over the site centre looking down at the ground. The remaining photos are taken standing at the site centre looking out along each transect tape, starting at transect 1 (which is always the transect pointing north for non-cropped sites) and working around in a clockwise direction. Photographs are labelled according to a standard format of the study location name and the identifier of the targeted feature (G1 for the centre peg and L1, L2 etc. for the transects).; Vegetation Assessment Method: The vegetation assessment method describes the vegetation at the field site to inform measurements of fractional ground cover. The following measurements and observations are carried out: biomass of standing non-woody vegetation, average height of non-woody vegetation, average height of woody vegetation, fire evidence, perennial vegetation cover, tree basal area, cryptogam cover and colour, and dominant species identification and cover.; Physical Assessment Method: The physical assessment method evaluates and records the physical characteristics of the study location as context for the fractional cover measurements. This method describes the condition of the soil at the field site to determine how well cover indicates soil condition, and to provide information about soil and land which may influence spectral readings for remote sensing of vegetative fractional cover. Observed attributes include erosion, deposited materials, micro relief, soil disturbance, soil surface condition, strength and cracks, soil colour, coarse fragment (rock) colour and cover, slope and aspect.; Cover Assessment Method: The cover assessment method measures the ground cover (non-woody vegetation such as grasses, forbs, and herbs, litter, cryptogams, soil and rock), woody vegetation less than two metres high, and woody vegetation greater than two metres high. These measurements are taken at one-metre intervals along three point-intercept transects arranged in a star-shape, with neighbouring transect forming angles of 60&amp;#176; or along two transects set up at 45&amp;#176; to crop lines for vegetation in rows (as described in the study location visit method). Once all point intercept values have been collected aggregated cover values are calculated by totalling the cover values for all surveyed points along the transects and dividing by the number of points: total cover, total ground cover, total woody cover less than two metres, total woody cover greater than two metres,  total soil crust ground cover, total disturbed soil ground cover, total rock ground cover, total green leaf non-woody vegetation ground cover, total dry leaf non-woody vegetation ground cover, total litter ground cover, total cryptogam ground cover, total green leaf woody vegetation less than two metres, total dry leaf woody vegetation cover less than two metres, total branch woody vegetation cover less than two metres, total live in-crown woody vegetation cover greater than two metres, total green leaf woody vegetation cover greater than two metres, total dry leaf woody vegetation cover greater than two metres, and total branch woody vegetation cover greater than two metres. Aggregated cover values are also calculated for the ground layer: total bare soil cover (soil crust plus disturbed soil plus rock plus cryptogram), total photosynthetic non-woody vegetation (green leaf), total non-photosynthetic non-woody vegetation (dry leaf plus litter) and total non-woody vegetation (ground cover). This data can be used to validate the cover estimates determined using the MODIS or Landsat satellite images.</description>
