to short- and long-term variation in abiotic and biotic aspects of the
environment.  Several perennial life forms, including tree Juniper and
Pinus, shrub Larrea and grass Oryzopsis and Sporobolus, are being
monitored at 1-3 of four sites which differ in elevation and
topography as well as edaphic and annual precipitation
characteristics.  The sites represent optimal or marginal/transitional
zones for particular species and permit specific hypotheses to be
tested (e.g., relative impact of wet vs.  dry years on C3 [Oryzopsis]
vs. C4 [Sporobolus] grasses).  Demographic measurements are made
biannually, after the &apos;wet&apos; (fall) and &apos;dry&apos; (spring) seasons.  For
tree and shrub species, estimates of growth and reproduction are based
on branch demography.  Ten replicate branch tips each of 10-20
individuals per species per site are monitored.  For Juniperus, Pinus
and Larrea, vegetative growth of branch as well as reproduction are
monitored.  Additional measurements include needle length for Pinus
and leaf production, leaf size and branchlet production for Larrea .
For Oryzopsis and Sporobolus, which are both bunch grasses, basal
diameter, leaf length and reproduction are monitored for 100
individuals per species per site.
Demographic data coordinate with physiological measurements to
elucidate the physiological bases of changes in growth and
reproduction.</literalLayout></para></abstract><keywordSet><keyword keywordType="place">Sevilleta NWR, Five Points, Rio Salado</keyword><keyword keywordType="theme"></keyword><keyword keywordType="theme">Branch demography</keyword><keyword keywordType="theme">Larrea tridentata (LATR2)</keyword><keyword keywordType="place">Creosote</keyword><keyword keywordType="taxonomic">Plant</keyword><keyword keywordType="theme">Ecology</keyword><keyword keywordType="theme"></keyword></keywordSet><intellectualRights><section><title>DATA USE POLICY</title><para><literalLayout>Any Sevilleta LTER data set and accompanying metadata can be used for academic, research, and other professional purposes.
