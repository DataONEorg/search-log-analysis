      <abstract>A bare earth elevation map (also known as a Digital Elevation Model, or DEM) of the northern Gulf of Mexico barrier islands and Naval Live Oaks was produced from remotely sensed, geographically referenced elevation measurements cooperatively by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the National Park Service (NPS), and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Elevation measurements were collected over the area using the NASA Experimental Advanced Airborne Research Lidar (EAARL), a pulsed-laser ranging system mounted onboard an aircraft to measure ground elevation, vegetation canopy, and coastal topography. The system uses high-frequency laser beams directed at the Earth's surface through an opening in the bottom of the aircraft's fuselage. The laser system records the time difference between emission of the laser beam and the reception of the reflected laser signal in the aircraft. The plane travels over the target area at approximately 50 meters per second at an elevation of approximately 300 meters. The EAARL, developed by NASA at Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia, measures ground elevation with a vertical resolution of 15 centimeters. A sampling rate of 3 kilohertz or higher results in an extremely dense spatial elevation dataset. Over 100 kilometers of coastline can be surveyed easily within a 3- to 4-hour mission. When subsequent elevation maps for an area are analyzed, they provide managers with a useful tool to make management decisions regarding land development.

For more information on Lidar science and the Experimental Advanced Airborne Research Lidar (EAARL) system and surveys, see http://ngom.usgs.gov/dsp/overview/index.php and http://ngom.usgs.gov/dsp/tech/eaarl/index.php .</abstract>
      <purpose>The purpose of this project was to produce a highly detailed and accurate bare earth digital elevation map of the northern Gulf of Mexico barrier islands for use as a management tool and to make these data available to natural resource managers and research scientists.</purpose>
      <supplinf>Unprocessed Lidar data are not in a format that is generally usable by resource managers and scientists. Converting dense Lidar elevation data into a readily usable format without loss of essential information requires specialized processing. The U.S. Geological Survey's Coastal and Marine Geology (CMG) Program has developed custom software to convert unprocessed Lidar data into a GIS-compatible map product to be provided to GIS specialists, managers, and scientists. The primary tool used in the conversion process is Advanced Lidar Processing System (ALPS), a multi-tiered processing system developed by a USGS-NASA collaborative project. Specialized processing algorithms are used to convert unprocessed waveform Lidar data acquired by the EAARL to georeferenced spot (x,y,z) returns for "bare earth" topography. These data are then converted to the North American Datum of 1983 and the North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (using the GEOID 03 model).  The files are in the Quarter-Quad tiling format and are named after the U.S. Geological Survey Alpha Quarter-Quad naming convention ('QQ_naming_convention.doc'). The development of custom software for creating these data products has been supported by the U.S. Geological Survey CMG Program's Decision Support for Coastal Parks, Sanctuaries, and Preserves project. Processed data products are used by the U.S. Geological Survey CMG Program's National Assessments of Coastal Change Hazards project to quantify the vulnerability of shorelines to coastal change hazards such as severe storms, sea-level rise, and shoreline erosion and retreat.</supplinf>

      <attraccr>The expected accuracy of the measured variables are as follows: attitude within 0.07 degree, 3 cm nominal laser ranging accuracy, and vertical elevation accuracy of +/-15 cm for the topographic surface. Quality checks are built into the data-processing software.</attraccr>

    <logic>Each file contains data located in USGS 24K Quarter-Quadrangle tile and are named after the USGS Alpha Quarter-Quad naming convention. AAOOOaoq, where AA is the positive whole number component of the  latitude. OOO is the positive whole number component of the longitude (zero-padded to a width of 3); a is an alpha character a-h designating the quad in the degree of latitude; where a is closest to 0 minutes and h is closest to the next full degree. Each represents 1/8 of a degree; o is a numeral 1-8 designating the quad in the degree of longitude, where 1 is closest to 0 minutes and 8 is closest to the next full degree. Each represents 1/8 of a degree; q is an alpha character a-d designating which quarter in the quad, where a is SE, b is NE, c is NW, and d is SW. Each Quarter-Quad is 1/16 of a degree in latitude and 1/16 of a degree in longitude.</logic>
    <complete>Several regions of the dataset are labeled as "No Data", which corresponds to a cell value of -32767 m  in the GeoTIFF file. These "No Data" areas are a result of the survey not covering a particular region, optical water depth of greater than 1.5 Secchi disc depths, or the manual removal of lidar processing artifacts.</complete>

        <procdesc>The data are collected using a Cessna 310 aircraft. The NASA Experimental Advanced Airborne Research Lidar (EAARL) laser scanner collects the data using a green (532 nm) raster scanning laser, while a digital camera acquires a visual record of the flight. The data are stored on hard drives and archived at the U.S. Geological Survey office in St. Petersburg and the NASA office at Wallops Flight Facility. The navigational data are processed at Wallops Flight Facility. The navigational and unprocessed data are then downloaded into the Advanced Lidar Processing System (ALPS). Data are converted from units of time to x,y,z points for elevation. The derived surface data can then be converted into raster data (geoTIFFS).</procdesc>
