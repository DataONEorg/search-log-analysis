      <abstract>This dataset consists of linear features depicting the main road running through the Natchez Trace Parkway and other roads visible on the color infrared photography. The Parkway is a 715-km roadway that historically connected the southern portions of the Mississippi River to the salt licks in central Tennessee. The vector data represent the roadway of the Parkway at an approximate along-track (parallel and perpendicular to the road) with a spatial accuracy of about 3 meters or less.</abstract>
      <purpose>To provide the National Park Service with a vector representation of the Natchez Trace Parkway and intersecting/nearby roads.  This shapefile can be layered over the map to identify the location of roads along the Natchez Trace Parkway.</purpose>

    <datacred>The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), National Wetlands Research Center (NWRC) would like to thank Paul Conzelman and Martha Segura of the National Park Service for allowing us the opportunity to contribute to the landcover mapping of the Nation's resources and Kurt Foote of the National Park Service for his guidance and vital help in our field reconnaissance. Partial funding for this work was provided through the U.S. National Park Service Agreement Number 14431A53200000. We are grateful to Steve Hartley (USGS) for his development of critical geographic information system (GIS) procedures and help in GIS processing.

The USGS NWRC would also like to acknowledge Gulf Coast Aerial Mapping Co., Inc. for the generation of the aerial photography.</datacred>

    <complete>The entire Natchez Trace Parkway was driven while GPS points were accquired and later mapped.  Linear features labeled as 'other roads' were manually mapped from color infrared photography.  Where portions of these 'other roads' couldn't be seen in the imagery (e.g., covered by tree canopy) they were not mapped and therefore appear unconnected to the main Parkway.</complete>

      <horizpa>
        <horizpar>The accuracy of the horizontal positions is based on the accuracy of the GPS unit used and the post-processing of the points. Garmin specifications for the GPSMAP 176C: position less than 15 meters (95% of the time) and velocity of 0.05 meter/sec steady state. See the Garmin website for further specifications (http://www.garmin.com).</horizpar>

        <procdesc>Color infrared (CIR) aerial photography was acquired during leaf-on conditions. The flights occurred on September 29-30 and October 6 and 15, 2004. The resulting aerial film rolls were then scanned at 25 microns by using a true color, true optics scanner to generate a 1,000-dot per inch (dpi) product and converted to DOQQs. The effects of tilt and relief were removed from the aerial photos by orthorectification.  The transformation of the photographic frames to DOQQ representation provided uniform scale. Uniform scale allowed the direct measure of true distance and direction.  The tiles were then cut to match existing DOQQs in the UTM projection zones.  

The 235 DOQQs created from the 386 aerial frames were mosaiced to create full coverage of the Parkway.  The resulting file was too large for most computers to handle and was split into 11 mosaics and then further subdivided into tiles (10 tiles/mosaic).

        <procdesc>Driving along the Parkway at 45 miles per hour, GPS points were taken in a continuous stream mode using a GARMIN GPSMAP 176C. The GPS unit was hooked to an external antenna attached to a vehicle and plugged into a laptop with a serial connection. National Marine Electronic Association (NMEA) sentences from the GPS were recorded every 2 seconds. The points were then converted into vector format by extracting latitude and longitude from the NMEA sentences. The geographic coordinates were converted to shapefiles by using embedded X tools in Arcview 3.2. The vector data was then modified to delete all off-road stops.</procdesc>
