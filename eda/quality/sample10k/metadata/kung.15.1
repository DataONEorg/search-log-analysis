The difference between the S/C values of Taichung Harbor and the Sihhu area was the largest at 10.12-fold. The ratio of Taichung Harbor to Sihhu was as great as a 11.12. The difference of Tongsiao and the Hengchun Peninsula for Acacia confusa was 2.66-fold. The S/C value obviously decreases as the C value increases and results in an increase in the understory plants’ carbon storage. Meanwhile, the variety of species was affected, and showed a negative correlation. The negative correlation between biomass and species was not significant, with a value of -0.136.</para></abstract><keywordSet><keyword>carbon stock</keyword><keyword>understory plant</keyword><keyword>biomass</keyword><keyword>S/C value</keyword></keywordSet><intellectualRights><para>當用則用，愛用盡量用</para></intellectualRights><coverage scope="document"><geographicCoverage scope="document"><geographicDescription>台灣北中南東區</geographicDescription><boundingCoordinates><westBoundingCoordinate>120.125</westBoundingCoordinate><eastBoundingCoordinate>122.125</eastBoundingCoordinate><northBoundingCoordinate>25.625</northBoundingCoordinate><southBoundingCoordinate>21.25</southBoundingCoordinate></boundingCoordinates></geographicCoverage><temporalCoverage scope="document"><singleDateTime><calendarDate>2006</calendarDate></singleDateTime></temporalCoverage><taxonomicCoverage scope="document"><taxonomicClassification><taxonRankName>Species</taxonRankName><taxonRankValue>Acacia confusa</taxonRankValue></taxonomicClassification></taxonomicCoverage></coverage><contact id="1259144297778" scope="document"><individualName><surName>洪昆源</surName></individualName><organizationName>森林化學組</organizationName><positionName>助理研究員</positionName></contact><methods><methodStep><description><section><title>取樣、碳濃度分析</title><para>In this study, the choice of plots and data analysis, such as quoted from the understory carbon inventory of the literature of plant (Chen, 2007). The group analysis of understory plants in this study, including trees with a diameter at breast height of &lt; 1 cm, contained dicot herbs, monocot herbs, and ferns (Augspurger, 2003 #55). Three to four areas of 30 x 30 m2 were sampled from each district. Five small areas of 5 x 5 m2 were set up at the four corners and in the middle of each 30 x 30 m2 sample area. A record was made for the five small sample areas, including the plant species and understory biomass. All kinds of bushes in one of the small sample areas were calculated based on whole plants. The understory plants were measured based on the total of the roots, stems, and leaves. One hundred grams of fresh sample was taken back to the lab and then dried in an oven at 80 °C. After completely drying, the sample was weighed, and obtained samples of dry weight and fresh weight, which was used to estimate the total dried weight of the understory plants in the sampled area (Jones et al. 1991). Next, select a small number of samples of clean and roughly ground then pulverized to a fine grain by machine. Then the grain was screened through a standard #140 mesh to obtain pieces of &lt; 0.5 mm, and 2~4 mg of the final sample was chosen and dried at 105 °C until it was totally dry. Finally, the carbon percentage of the sample was measured by an Elememtar elemental analyzer system. The procedure was repeated three times for all samples.</para></section></description><instrumentation>元素分析儀</instrumentation></methodStep></methods><access authSystem="knb" order="denyFirst" scope="document"><allow><principal>public</principal><permission>read</permission></allow></access></dataset></eml:eml>
