      <abstract>This part of DS 781 presents data for the folds for the geologic and geomorphic map of the Offshore Pigeon Point map area, California. The vector data file is included in "Folds_OffshorePigeonPoint.zip," which is accessible from http://dx.doi.org/10.5066/F7513W80
The offshore Pigeon Point map area lies about 15 to 25 km southwest of the San Andreas Fault, the dominant structure in the distributed transform boundary between the North American and Pacific plates. The map area straddles the right-lateral Pigeon Point Fault zone, a prominent structure west of the San Andreas Fault in the broader San Andreas Fault system. The Pigeon Point Fault zone occurs predominantly in the offshore and extends 400 km from Point Conception on the south to Bolinas and Point Reyes on the north (Dickinson and others, 2005), coming onland at coastal promontories such as Pescadero Point in the map area and Pillar Point, a few km north of Half Moon Bay.
In the offshore, the Pigeon Point Fault system forms a distributed shear zone about 2 to 4 km wide that includes two main diverging fault strands. The western strand (also known as the Frijoles Fault) extends offshore from Pescadero Point. The eastern strand (also known as the Coastways Fault or Seal Cove Fault), is mostly onshore in this map area. Cumulative lateral slip on the Pigeon Point Fault zone is thought to range from 4 to 10 mm/yr in this region (U.S. Geological Survey, 2010). The western strand of the Pigeon Point Fault zone (i.e., Frijoles Fault) forms the eastern boundary of the Pigeon Point high.
Folds were primarily mapped by interpretation of seismic reflection profile data (see OFR 2013-1071).  The seismic reflection profiles were collected between 2007 and 2010.

      <purpose>To expand geologic mapping to the seafloor within the California's State
Waters, to update coastal geologic mapping, and to contribute to a
uniform regional geologic database. Additionally, to provide a geologic
map for the public and geoscience community to aid in assessments and
mitigation of geologic hazards in the Pigeon Point coastal region
and to provide sufficient geologic information for land-use and
land-management decisions both onshore and offshore.

  <dataqual>
    <logic>Map elements were visually checked for overshoots,
undershoots, duplicate features, and other errors by the
lead authors and by the GIS technician(s) who created the digital database.
Review drafts of the map were reviewed internally by at least two other geologists for consistency
with basic geologic principles and general conformity to USGS mapping
standards.</logic>
    <complete>Data are complete: no offshore features that could be accurately identified and
represented at the compilation scale of 1:24,000 were eliminated or
generalized. The smallest area represented is approximately 100 square
meters. All geospatial database elements are attributed.</complete>
    <posacc>
      <horizpa>
        <horizpar>Folds were primarily mapped by interpretation of seismic reflection profile data (see OFR 2013-1071).
Folds lines were digitized by heads-up screen digitization on to shot point picks from seismic
line navigation data - each shot point has an associated lat/long in the survey data. Error is introduced
from layback, as well as from interpretation of oblique features, so horizontal accuracy of fault and fold
location is estimated to be on the order of 10 to 20 meters.</horizpar>
