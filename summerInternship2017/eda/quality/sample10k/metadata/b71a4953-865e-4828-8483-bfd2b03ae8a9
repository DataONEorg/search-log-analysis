      <abstract>Aeromagnetic and aeroradiometric data were collected along flight lines by
instruments in an aircraft that recorded magnetic-field and radiometric
values and locations.  The magnetic data set presents latitude, longitude,
altitude, and magnetic-field values.  Geologic symbols or codes are also
included.  The geologic symbols were picked from surficial geologic maps.
The radiometric data set presents latitude, longitude, altitude, geologic
symbols or codes, apparent Uranium (Bismuth 214), Thorium (Thallium 208),
and Potassium (K 40), the element ratios, and ancillary information.</abstract>
      <purpose>Aeromagnetic surveys are used for geophysical prospecting.  Some
variations in magnetic measurements are caused by rocks that contain
significant amounts of magnetic minerals (magnetite being the most common).
These anomalies reflect variations in the amount and type of magnetic
material and the shape and depth of the body of rock.
Aeromagnetic anomaly maps are important tools in mapping surficial and
buried igneous rocks.  The features and patterns of aeromagnetic anomalies
can also be used to delineate details of subsurface geology including the
locations of buried faults and the thickness of surficial sedimentary rocks.
Aeroradiometric surveys measure the radiation emanating from the earth's
surface, which provides general estimates of the geographic distribution of
uranium, thorium, and potassium in surficial and some bedrock units.
Bismuth 214 and Thallium 208 are decay products of Uranium and Thorium.
Along with Potassium 40 they give identifiable peaks in the gamma-ray spectra
of naturally occurring radiation. The element data and the ratios of the
element data are used to help map surficial geology and to detect
concentrations of radioactive minerals.</purpose>
      <supplinf>The U.S. Department of Energy through Bendix Corp. contracted
numerous airborne surveys over a period from 1974 to 1981 covering most
of the conterminous United States and much of Alaska.  The primary
purpose was to obtain airborne radiometric data in order to locate and
evaluate uranium resources.  Aeromagnetic data were also acquired at
the same time.  In the mid-1980's, all the NURE Program's data were
given to the U.S. Geological Survey.  The aeromagnetic data were also
archived at the National Geophysical Data Center. With the improvement
in digital communication and the ability to store and transmit large
data sets, the USGS is now able to release the flight-line data in a
common format.
The U.S. Geological Survey has contracted or flown numerous airborne
surveys over a long period (1950's to present).  Much of the digital
flight-line data have been released to the public through a companion
DVD and a web site.  Reference is in the Cross-Reference section of
this metadata file.
A companion CD-ROM/web site has been released containing magnetic
data that were generated by digitizing analog maps.  The original
analog flight-line profiles used to create the analog maps are
unavailable.  Reference is in the Cross-Reference section of this
metadata file.
CD's have been released containing the original radiometric flight-line
data in various formats.  Reference is in the Cross-Reference section
of this metadata file.</supplinf>

    <attracc>
      <attraccr>The data in this file have been processed using various formulas and
methods that are not usually documented but that represent
industry standard practices for airborne data reduction.  For example,
position is listed as latitude and longitude, but these values
were derived from the raw navigation data depending on the system used.
(see notes under horizontal accuracy). Line numbers were added to
records, and unusable data at flight-line ends were discarded
(as aircraft slowed and turned around). Separate recordings were
correlated by time and assigned to the correct location.
The exact accuracies of these processing steps may not be known.
They are discussed in the sections on attribute or positional
accuracies.</attraccr>
    </attracc>
    <logic>The data in this file were collected by a single contractor or group
who were responsible for collecting and processing the data.
The data from this survey were collected using the same instruments
(magnetometers, altimeters, radiometic crystal packages, navigational
systems) throughout the survey and were collected in a normal length of
time with no long delays between survey beginning and end.
Survey contracts specified the conditions and specifications under which
these data were collected.  Standard industry practices of the time
were followed in data collection and processing.</logic>
    <complete>Loss of data due to poor transmission, channel dropout, obvious spiking,
missing channels, and other obvious errors were replaced with one of the
Following values: -9999.9, -999.9, -99, etc.  Sometimes channels were
added and filled with dummy values (-9999.9, etc.) to comply with the
established format.  Records that had no usable data were deleted.</complete>
    <posacc>
      <horizpa>
        <horizpar>Flight Path Recovery
The horizontal position of the survey aircraft used to collect
data was determined by reconciling down-looking photographs
(recorded on continuous-strip film) with topographic maps
and orthophotoquadrangle maps.  Fiducial numbers and marks,
impressed on any paper strips that were recording data or
added to magnetic tape records, were included
as a function of time to further reconcile location with
instrumentation.</horizpar>
      </horizpa>
      <vertacc>
        <vertaccr>The aircraft vertical position was determined using the
navigational positioning equipment on the aircraft, which
were radar altimeter and barometric altimeter.  Barometric
altimeter data are not available for most of these data sets.
Radar altimeters are estimated to have an error
of 2-5% of the altitude (Richard Hansen, PRJ, Inc.,
written communication).
The magnetometer was mounted on the side of the helicopter.</vertaccr>

Conversion processes, if reported, may be found in the
U.S. Department of Energy's published GJO- or GJBX- reports for the

        <procdesc>USGS reformatting of contractor data to standard format.
USGS personnel used the software package Oasis Montaj version 6.3 by
Geosoft, Inc., to read in the original contractor's data.  Positioning
and magnetic values were checked for obvious errors or spikes. Values
of -9999.9,-999.9, -99.9, etc., were given where the value could not be
reasonably corrected or, in some cases, the whole record was removed.
Information that was missing from the data file but recorded elsewhere, such
as year flown, was added th the file. The radiometric data were not checked
for errors except for dummy values which were replaced with -99.9, -999.9, etc.
The reformatted data files were written in the format described in the section
on Entity_and_Attribute_Overview.</procdesc>

        <attrdef>Raw magnetic value with base magnetometer corrections applied.
Because the magnetic field of the earth varies diurnally,
a stationary base magnetometer is maintained on the ground
during airborne surveying.  The base magnetometer records
changes in the magnetic field (in nanoTeslas) as a function
of time.  The magnetic changes may have an amplitude of 20
to 50 nanoTeslas.  If changes are more severe, as would
occur from a magnetic storm, surveying is discontinued or
the data recorded are not used.
Diurnal variations are then removed from the airborne magnetic
data based on the common time.
Records containing missing data were usually deleted.</attrdef>

        <attrdef>residual magnetic value
The total magnetic value minus a geomagnetic reference field (GRF),
which is a long-wavelength regional magnetic field.  The most commonly
used reference field is determined from a model developed by the
International Association of Geomagnetism and Aeronomy (IAGA).  The
International Geomagnetic Reference Field (IGRF), is a predictive model
adopted at the beginning of a model period (e.g. in 1989 for 1990-1995).
After the model period, a revised definitive model is adopted, the DGRF.
This is the preferred model to use for removing regional magnetic fields
for epochs when CM models are not available.
For this survey, the field removed is IGRF 1975.
Some contractors add a constant to the residual value in order to
avoid negative values.  This constant can vary from one data set to
another.

Because the magnetic field of the earth varies diurnally,

changes in the magnetic field (in nanoTeslas) as a function
of time called the diurnal.  The magnetic changes may have an
amplitude of 20 to 50 nanoTeslas.  The diurnal is monitored
during the survey and if changes are severe, as would
occur from a magnetic storm, surveying is discontinued or
