    <descript>
      <abstract>In 1999, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), in partnership with the South Carolina Sea Grant Consortium, began a study to investigate processes affecting shoreline change along the northern coast of South Carolina, focusing on the Grand Strand region. Previous work along the U.S. Atlantic coast shows that the structure and composition of older geologic strata located seaward of the coast heavily influences the coastal behavior of areas with limited sediment supply, such as the Grand Strand. By defining this geologic framework and identifying the transport pathways and sinks of sediment, geoscientists are developing conceptual models of the present-day physical processes shaping the South Carolina coast. The primary objectives of this research effort are: 1) to provide a regional synthesis of the shallow geologic framework underlying the coastal upland, shoreface and inner continental shelf, and define its role in coastal evolution and modern beach behavior; 2) to identify and model the physical processes affecting coastal ocean circulation and sediment transport, and to define their role in shaping the modern shoreline; and 3) to identify sediment sources and transport pathways; leading to construction of a regional sediment budget.</abstract>
      <purpose>This data set contains a hillshade of the swath bathymetric data collected between 1999 and 2003. These data are used to define the sea-floor morphology offshore of the Grand Strand, South Carolina.</purpose>

    <attracc>
      <attraccr>These data are internally consistent and have been compared to multibeam and single-beam bathymetric surveys to check for accuracy. Any differences between this bathymetric data set and others were determined to be within acceptable error given the inherent differences in the various bathymetric data sets (i.e. acquisition system, mode of navigation, density of point, and or swath bathymetry).</attraccr>

    <logic>A hillshade was applied to the final bathymetric grid. Any spurious data
were removed during processing.</logic>
    <complete>These data represent all bathymetric data collected by the USGS offshore
of Myrtle Beach, SC 1999 - 2003.  Any spurious data were removed during
processing.</complete>
    <posacc>
      <horizpa>
        <horizpar>DGPS is assumed to be accurate within 1-2 meters. Standard GPS is assumed accurate within 5-10 meters. 99% of the positional data is DGPS. Unless noted, all GPS/DGPS data is referenced to WGS84 (NAD83). The configuration of the fathometer is as follows: The fathometer is mounted on either the port or starboard side of the vessel. Offset between the sidemount and GPS antennae is measured. No measurements were taken of ship's pitch, yaw, heave, or change in draft due to water and fuel usage. Motion of the fathometer is not measured. Horizontal accuracy of the fathometer is assumed to be within  3 meters.</horizpar>
      </horizpa>
      <vertacc>
        <vertaccr>Ship motion was recorded with a TSS DMS 2-05 Attitude Sensor, mounted directly above the SEA SwathPlus transducers. Navigation was recorded using a Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS). The interferometric sonar is an angle-measuring system; depth accuracy decreases with increasing horizontal range. The combined angular accuracy of the SwathPlus system and the TSS DMS 2-05 attitude sensor is documented as 0.1 degrees.  Assuming a constant angular accuracy, and using the International Hydrographic Standard (IHO) of a required 0.3 meter accuracy in &lt; 30 meter water depth, all data collected within the survey fall within the IHO accuracy standards. However, vertical accuracy is also directly affected by the accuracy of both the navigation system and tidal measurements.</vertaccr>

      <procstep>
        <procdesc>Bathymetric data were corrected for variations in the speed of sound throughout the water column; sound velocity profiles were acquired throughout the survey area using an Applied MicroSystems SVPlus Sound Velocimeter. These data were downloaded and reformatted to the required format needed for use within University of New Brunswick's Ocean Mapping Group (OMG) SwathEd multibeam processing software. The raw Submetrix 2000 Series data were "unraveled" and reformatted into the OMG format. This process creates several files on disk:
1) bathymetric soundings
2) raw sidescan-sonar backscatter
3) navigation
4) parameter files describing the configuration of the system
(i.e. offsets between motion reference unit and GPS antenna, etc).
This process also incorporates the sound velocity profiles in order to properly trace the rays given the structure of the water column.</procdesc>

        <procdesc>Navigation data output during the unravel were reformatted for entry into MATLAB.  The time of day and position were used to extract the tidal elevation from within the ADCIRC circulation model. The ADCIRC circulation model is referenced to Mean Sea Level.  Verified tidal data from the NOAA tidal gauge at SpringMaid Pier, SC were downloaded, referenced to Mean Lower Low Water (MLLW). A low-pass filter was applied to the NOAA tide data; the residual was assumed to represent the wind component of sea surface elevations. Tidal elevation (output from ADCIRC) and wind component (NOAA tide station) represent total variation in surface elevations.  These data were then written to an ASCII file and reformatted to OMG format for use within SwathEd.  The tidal data were then written into the headers of the OMG formatted files, using the 'mergedTide' command.
(SwathEd Commands:
binTide -year XXX adcirc_wind.txt tide.bin
mergeTide -tide tide.bin *.merged
)
SwathEd Software was used to grid the bathymetric data at 20 m grid cell size utilizing the 'weigh_grid' command.
weigh_grid -omg -butter -power 2 -cutoff 10 -lambda 2.5 Grid *.merged
The gridded data were then viewed using the SwathEd Jview Command. The PatchTool was used to assess the roll misalignment of the data; slight roll misalignment artifacts were visible in the gridded data.  The PatchTool is a QC tool to assess the degree to which the head (transducers and MRU) needs to be 'rolled' to achieve the proper alignment.  QC was also preformed on the navigation. Edits were made as necessary. After the needed adjustments were recorded, the configuration and navigation were remerged with the OMG bathymetric data using the mergeNav and mergeAtt commands.
mergeNav -use_params 0 -nav *.nav -swath *.merged)
The remerged data were regridded for a second round of QC.  The roll misalignment artifacts were no longer visible in the gridded data.
The bathymetric data to this point have been edited, navigation, edited, tidal elevations relative to MLLW incorporated in the data, sound velocity corrections applied, and roll misalignment rectified. Next the data need to be interpolated to generate a continuous bathymetric surface.
The SwathEd 'make_blank' command was used to generate a 20 meter grid for the survey area.  The OMG formatted bathymetric files were then written into the 20 meter grid using the 'weigh_grid' command.
Due to noise within the far range of the sonar signal, the 'max_incidence'  parameter was used.  This essentially limits the across track data range of the data; thus elimination noise.
(weigh_grid -omg -butter -power 2 -cutoff 20 -lambda 10  -max_incidence 60 Grid *.merged)
The 20 meter gridded data were then exported to an xyz ASCII file.

        <procdesc>Edits to the metadata were made to fix any errors that MP v 2.9.32 flagged. This is necessary to enable the metadata to be successfully harvested for various data catalogs. In some cases, this meant adding text "Information unavailable" or "Information unavailable from original metadata" for those required fields that were left blank. Other minor edits were probably performed (title, publisher, publication place, etc.). An online link was changed to point to pubs.usgs.gov. Date range format had to be fixed. The distribution format name was modified in an attempt to be more consistent with other metadata files of the same data format. The metadata date (but not the metadata creator) was edited to reflect the date of these changes. The metadata available from a harvester may supersede metadata bundled within a download file. Compare the metadata dates to determine which metadata file is most recent.</procdesc>
