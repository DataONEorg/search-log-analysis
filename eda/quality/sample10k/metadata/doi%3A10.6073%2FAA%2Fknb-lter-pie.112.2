2002

Continuous measurements, every 15 minutes, were made of stage, water temperature, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, and pH in a small headwater stream draining a mainly forested catchment (55% forest + 19% wetland).  Measurements are for the ice free season (March &#226;&#128;&#147; December).  Discharge is determined from stage using discharge vs stage regressions.  Several day gaps occur periodically due to removal for recalibration.</title><creator scope="document"><individualName><givenName>Charles</givenName><surName>Vorosmarty</surName></individualName><address scope="document"><deliveryPoint>ISEOS</deliveryPoint><deliveryPoint>University of New Hampshire</deliveryPoint><city>Durham</city><administrativeArea>NH</administrativeArea><postalCode>03824</postalCode><country>United States of America</country></address><phone phonetype="voice">603-862-1792</phone><phone phonetype="fax">603-862-0188</phone><electronicMailAddress>charles.vorosmarty@unh.edu</electronicMailAddress></creator><metadataProvider scope="document"><organizationName>Plum Island Ecosystem LTER</organizationName><address scope="document"><deliveryPoint>The Ecosystems Center</deliveryPoint><deliveryPoint>Marine Biological Laboratory</deliveryPoint><city>Woods Hole</city><administrativeArea>MA</administrativeArea><postalCode>02543</postalCode><country>United States of America</country></address><phone phonetype="voice">508-289-7688</phone><phone phonetype="fax">508-457-1548</phone><electronicMailAddress>pie_im@mbl.edu</electronicMailAddress><onlineUrl>http://ecosystems.mbl.edu/PIE/</onlineUrl></metadataProvider><associatedParty scope="document"><individualName><givenName>Wilfred</givenName><surName>Wollheim</surName></individualName><role>additional investigator</role></associatedParty><associatedParty scope="document"><individualName><givenName>Brian</givenName><surName>Pellerin</surName></individualName><role>additional investigator</role></associatedParty><abstract><para>Continuous measurements, every 15 minutes, were made of stage, water temperature, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, and pH in a small headwater stream draining a mainly forested catchment (55% forest + 19% wetland).

The stream is called Cart Creek, and largely drains the Martin Burns wildlife management area in Newbury MA.  Some residential area is present. (~ 10% of the basin).  In addition, I-95 passes through the center of the catchment, resulting in roughly 8% impervious surface area.

The sonde was deployed in a PVC tube, which was attached to ree-bar driven into the stream bed.  The PVC tube had holes drilled to allow adequate water circulation.  Dissolved oxygen measurements are of good quality because detritus did not accumulate in the bottom of the pool (unlike our suburban site).  The PVC tube was surveyed upon original deployment in 2001 and resurveyed in 2002 to ensure that elevation did not change during winter ice period. No change was detected. See discussion below for development of the discharge-stage relationship.  Recalibration was performed roughly every 4-6 weeks.  Instrument drift during deployment periods was not significant.</literalLayout></para><para><literalLayout>Notes: Discharge measurements in Cart Creek are based on a exponential rating curve that contains measurements up to a depth of 0.475m.  Flows above this amount are estimated using a linear extrapolation using the six measurements with the highest flow.  Thus flows determined from levels greater than 0.475m are approximate (roughly 15% of the readings in 2003 deployment period).  Rating curve below 0.475m is based on a power relationship with an R2 = 0.99.  Measurements are based on 17 measurements taken between 2001 and 2003.  
Dissolved oxygen concentrations reflect water column levels.
NA refers to data not available.</literalLayout></para><para><literalLayout>Calculations: When stage in Cart Cr. is less than 0.475m :
