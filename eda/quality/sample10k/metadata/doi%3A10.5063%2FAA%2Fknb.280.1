<title>Diadema predation and recruitment</title>
<para>Study Site
	This study was conducted on the island of Moorea, French Polynesia (17?30? S, 149?50? W). Fieldwork was conducted in a total of 10 study sites, all of which were lagoonal patch-reefs roughly 1-7m in depth. Three of these sites are located along the northern shores of Moorea, between Opunohu Bay and Ava Iti. The remaining seven sites are scattered throughout the eastern shores of the island between Temae and Maatea.

</para>
<para>Urchin Abundance
	Adult Diadema savignyi abundance was estimated annually during the Austral winters of 2009-2010 at each study site using 45 haphazardly placed 1-m2 quadrats. Care was taken to look under coral bommies and crevices for hidden urchins as these surveys were performed during the daytime. Surveys were limited to adult habitat areas only and therefore excluded rubble patches along the reef crest as well as areas consisting only of sand.
</para>
<para>Recruitment 
	Surveys were conducted every two weeks in rubble fields from June to August 2010 at each study site to quantify the number of new recruits in an area. Rubble from ten haphazardly placed 1-m2 quadrats were thoroughly searched for D. savignyi individuals at each site. Each rubble piece within the 1-m2 quadrat was manually searched for newly settled urchins until pavement or sand was hit. The test diameter (mm) of each individual was measured by vernier calipers along with the length of rubble (mm) on which an individual was found. Other measurements included the total number of individuals found on a piece of rubble and the depth (mm) of the rubble patch.
	To determine the amount of growth that occurs in newly settled urchins over the course of two-weeks, 40 individuals with test diameters no larger than 12mm were collected from rubble patches in June 2010 and then transported to the laboratories at the University of California, Berkeley Gump Field Station. Urchins were kept in aquariums with flowing sea-water and given a constant supply of turf algae for a total of 9 weeks. Test diameters (mm) of individuals were measured weekly and the weekly growth rate was calculated using a simple linear regression.
	The total amount of rubble area for each study site was measured by snorkelers. Transect tapes were used to quantify the width and length (in meters) of each rubble field. The total area of each study site was estimated using the software Google Earth (version 5.2.1) and the amount of total suitable juvenile habitat was calculated by dividing the rubble area by the total amount of reef area. Values were then standardized to amount of rubble per 100m2 of reef.
</para>
<para>Mortality 
	Urchins were collected in the field and brought back to the laboratory for tethering. Urchins were tethered using a hypodermic needle and a 14lb test monofilament line (McClanahan and Muthiga 1989). Urchins were tethered in the afternoon and returned to the field the following morning?individuals tethered for longer than 24 hours were not used in these experiments. Ten urchins were tethered along a 20m line at every other meter with each individual urchin having a 1 to 1.5m length of tether. Three 20m lines were strung, for a total of 30 urchins, at each study site with at least 8m between each line. 
All 30 tethered urchins were strung along the 20m line by 8AM and were observed every hour during daylight hours (typically from 7AM to 5PM) for a total of 48 hours. The first observation for every line occurred 0.5 hours after the urchins were strung and were then observed at every hour afterwards. For each individual urchin, the following measurements were recorded: test diameter (mm), type of shelter, number of hours until the individual was eaten, if the individual was eaten during the experiment, and the type of predator(s) seen eating the individual. Type of shelter was classified as one of four categories: (1) Open?in which an individual had no shelter, (2) Crevice?in which an individual was hidden in some type of shelter, (3) Aggregation?in which an individual was with other D. savignyi urchins, and (4) Aggregation and Crevice?in which an individual was in an aggregation with other urchins but was also underneath some type of shelter. Temporal variation in per capita mortality rate was examined by repeating the tethering experiment three times each at two different study sites. 
	 Predator abundance, specifically that of the orange-striped triggerfish, Balistapus undulatus, was recorded over each of the 20m lines. A 5m bandwidth was used such that any B. undulatus that was seen within 2.5m of either side of the 20m line was recorded. Predator abundance was recorded in both the presence and absence of tethered urchins for four successive hours starting at 8AM and ending at 12PM. 
Habitat complexity was estimated by taking rugosity measurements (straight line distance/bottom contour distance) using the above 20m line (McClanahan and Shafir 1990). Habitat complexity is the highest when rugosity is close to zero and lowest when rugosity equals one.
