      <abstract>
This part of DS 781 presents data for the acoustic-backscatter map of the Offshore of San Francisco map area, California. Backscatter data are provided as separate grids depending on mapping system used and processing techniques. The raster data file is included in "BackscatterC_8101_2008_OffshoreSanFrancisco.zip," which is accessible from http://pubs.usgs.gov/ds/781/OffshoreSanFrancisco/data_catalog_OffshoreSanFrancisco.html.

The acoustic-backscatter map of the Offshore of San Francisco Map Area, California was generated from backscatter data collected by Fugro Pelagos and by California State University, Monterey Bay (CSUMB). Mapping was completed between 2004 and 2008, using a combination of 400-kHz Reson 7125 and 244-kHz Reson 8101 multibeam echosounders. Within the final imagery, brighter tones indicate higher backscatter intensity, and darker tones indicate lower backscatter intensity. The intensity represents a complex interaction between the acoustic pulse and the seafloor, as well as characteristics within the shallow subsurface, providing a general indication of seafloor texture and composition. Backscatter intensity depends on the acoustic source level; the frequency used to image the seafloor; the grazing angle; the composition and character of the seafloor, including grain size, water content, bulk density, and seafloor roughness; and some biological cover. Harder and rougher bottom types such as rocky outcrops or coarse sediment typically return stronger intensities (high backscatter, lighter tones), whereas softer bottom types such as fine sediment return weaker intensities (low backscatter, darker tones).

        <procdesc>During the mapping missions, an Applanix position and motion compensation system (POS/MV) was used to accurately position the vessel during data collection, and it also accounted for vessel motion such as heave, pitch, and roll (position accuracy, +/-2 m; pitch, roll, and heading accuracy, +/-0.02 degress; heave accuracy, +/-5 percent, or 5 cm). KGPS altitude data (Fugro Pelagos, StarFix HP &amp; XP units; CSUMB, NavCom 2050) were used to account for tide cycle fluctuations and sound velocity profiles were collected with an Applied Microsystems SVPlus sound velocimeter. Soundings were corrected for vessel motion using the Applanix POS/MV data, for variations in water-column sound velocity using the AM SVPlus data, and for variations in water height (tides) using vertical-position data from the KGPS receivers. Backscatter data were processed using Geocoder in both Fugro Pelagos Modified Test Release 16 and Caris HIPS/SIPS versions. Within Geocoder, geobars were created using both the beam averaging and time series engines. Intensities were radiometrically corrected (including despeckling and angle varying gain adjustments) and the position of each acoustic sample was geometrically corrected for slant-range on a line-by-line basis. The contrast and brightness of some geobars were adjusted to better match the surrounding geobars. Individual geobars were mosaicked together at 1- and 2-m resolution using the auto seam method. The mosaics were then exported as georeferenced TIFF images, imported into a GIS, and converted to GRIDS at 2-m resolution.</procdesc>

        <procdesc>California Seafloor Mapping Project 1- and 2-m resolution backscatter imagery (CSMP survey blocks CC-00, CC-01, and SF West Bay) within this map were downloaded from California State University, Monterey Bay, Seafloor Mapping Lab (http://seafloor.csumb.edu/SFMLwebDATA.htm) and converted to grids. USGS also received original 2004 and 2005 CSUMB San Fancisco Mouth Caris project files and original mapping line files. Backscatter data were reprocessed using the Caris HIPS/SIPS version of Geocoder similar to the method described in the Processing Step above. Backscatter grids of similar mapping systems were merged in a GIS and clipped to the boundary of the map area. Grids from different mapping systems were not merged together due to different mapping frequencies and processing techniques.</procdesc>
