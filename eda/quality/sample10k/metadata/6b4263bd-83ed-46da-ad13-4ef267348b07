      <abstract>The Sprague River drains 4090 square kilometers in south-central Oregon before flowing into the Williamson River and upper Klamath Lake. In cooperation with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the USGS and University of Oregon conducted a study to evaluate channel and floodplain processes for the 131 km of the Sprague River and its major tributaries, including the lower 20 km of the South Fork Sprague River, the lower 16 km of the North Fork Sprague River, and the lower 62 km of the Sycan River. The study involved multiple analyses, including assessments of historical channel change, riparian and floodplain vegetation, and surficial geology. To support these analyses, digital floodplain and channel maps were prepared from historic notes, maps, and aerial photos to depict channel and floodplain conditions at different times between 1866 and 2005. The geospatial database of current and historic channel and floodplain conditions will also enable evaluation of long-term trends pertaining to aquatic and riparian habitat conditions.</abstract>
      <purpose>These data were created to support understanding of geomorphic conditions and historical changes to channel and floodplain conditions for the Sprague River and the lower portions of its major tributaries. GIS layers depicting channel centerlines, water features, fluvial bars, floodplain vegetation, and floodplain features such as irrigation canals, levees and dikes, and roads were created from aerial photographs dating from 1940, 1968, and 2000. The purpose of this mapping was to track changes in channel and floodplain morphology and vegetation over time and to measure changes in channel position. Historical aerial photographs from 1940 and 1968 were acquired, scanned, and rectified for this project, while digital orthophotographs from 2000 are publicly available. (See metadata for each photograph set for more information on the rectification process and resolution of each dataset). In addition, channel centerlines were mapped from publicly available coverages for 1975 (Natural Resources Conservation Service Soil Survey of Klamath County) and 2005 (U.S. Department of Agriculture NAIP imagery). The surficial geologic mapping was done to support understanding of the geologic context of the modern floodplain, and encompasses the alluvial valleys of the Sprague River and the lower portions of the Sycan, North Fork, and South Fork Sprague Rivers.</purpose>

      <attraccr>Image evaluation and feature interpretation occurred at a scale of 1:10,000 - 1:500.  Digitization of features occurred at a scale of 1:1,000.</attraccr>

    <logic>Topology rules were used to clean and edit features digitized within the floodplain boundary data set for overlap and boundary accuracy.  A separate topology was run to edit digitizing overlap with the floodplain boundary data set and the features digitized within it to ensure all features were enclosed within the final floodplain boundary.</logic>
    <complete>Data are complete. Digitization of features occurred at a scale of 1:1000.  In general, all features that were clearly visible at that scale were digitized.  Minimum size and density specifications for digitizing are listed in each attribute definition. Where vegetation overhang and shadows overlapped with other features within the floodplain boundary digitizing an accurate boundary of the covered feature was attempted.  Interpreting the boundary of the covered feature (Water, Built Feature or Bar) was done by extrapolating edges from visible data. Varied discharge associated with different photo dates occasionally resulted in discontinuity of water features at photo overlap and boundaries.  In the situation of discontinuity at overlap one photo was exchanged for a bordering photo at approximately the mid-point of overlap and features were digitized to the photo being utilized. When discontinuity occurred at image boundaries or the photo exchange point the water feature with the greatest area was digitized. Mean daily discharges associated with different photo dates are recorded in the Photo Sets and Related Stream Discharge.xls spreadsheet located inside the SpragueRiverAnalysis.mdb file. Built features are defined as landscape features within the defined floodplain boundary feature that were anthropologically constructed and have the potential to interact with channel process.  Data from the 2000 DOQs was digitized first.  LiDAR data were used to assist in identifying built features from the 2000 DOQs.  However, if the feature was visible in the LiDAR and there was no visible evidence of it in the 2000 photos, it was not digitized.  The 2000 built features were then used as a template for digitizing the1968 and 1940s Built Features by subtracting newer features and adding old features that had been destroyed before 2000.</complete>

        <procdesc>Rectification:  The photo rectification process warps an image across a set of specified points.  The warping leaves the edges of the image less spatially accurate than the center portion of the image.  To ensure the best accuracy of data, feature digitizing occurred nearest the center of the photo as possible on the rectified 1940s and 1968 photo sets.  One photo was exchanged for a bordering photo at approximately the mid-point of photo overlap.  Digitization on a photo's edge only occurred on the final most distal photo when there was no adjacent photo available. The historic 1968 aerial photo set rectified to the USGS 2000 DOQs. A goal of 20 ground control points (GCP) per photo was established (actual: 11-35 GCPs/photo).  Hard point landscape features (building or fence corners) were prioritized for rectification, then "soft point" features (trees, etc.) were used. GCP selection prioritized points nearest the river and the active floodplain to ensure accuracy of rectification warping in the study area. A goal of an RMSE &lt; 5m was established (actual: 1.75-4.5, with one outlier in a canyon section with and RMSE of 6.01). Rectification of photos used  2nd order polynomial.</procdesc>

        <procdesc>Digitizing:  1968 water features and river centerlines digitized. Completed in 2008. Digitizing Protocol:  The Sprague River Project is focused on geomorphic and vegetation changes over time within the active geomorphic floodplain of the Sprague River watershed. We defined the active geomorphic floodplain as the area adjacent to the channel system that is low-lying and displays geomorphic features typical of channel erosion and depositional processes clearly on imagery, including aerial photos, 7.5 min USGS topo maps, and LIDAR images (Watershed Sciences, 2005).  Geomorphic features used to define the extent of the active geomorphic floodplain included point bars, scroll bars, abandoned channels (including oxbows ponds and filled channels), and swell and swale topography.  The active geomorphic floodplain was distinguished from adjacent alluvial surfaces that are smoother and show less evidence of erosion and deposition, although some of these adjacent surfaces may be flooded regularly by overbank flows. Digital data sets were first digitized from the 2000 DOQs.  High resolution LiDAR imagery data (Watershed Sciences, 2005) was used to identify topographic details that assisted in feature classification.  If the feature visible in the LiDAR was not visible in the 2000 DOQ the feature was not digitized.  Additional comparison with the 1998 color air photo mosaic (USFWS 1998) aided in evaluating the 2000 DOQs. The 2000 digital data was then used as a template for digitizing features from the 1968 and 1940s photo sets.  Because the spatial context of this project is focused within the active geomorphic floodplain, interpreting and digitizing the floodplain boundary was prioritized to define area of digitization in all three year sets. Original data sets were digitized in ArcMap as separate shapefiles (line or polygon).  Line files were "buffered" in ArcMAP to generate polygons with a calculable area for these features. All digitizing was reviewed and edited by the graduate research assistants or project leaders for interpretation consistency and data accuracy.  After editing, the shapefiles were input into a geodatabase.  The geodatabase was used to organize the data sets by data type and subtype, feature prioritization, and topology rules.</procdesc>

            <edomvd>All visible roads, including paved roads, unpaved roads and farm roads, within the defined floodplain boundary.  Road features were linear and non-linear features, that are connected to bridges (except railroad bridges) and other vehicle access points such as parking areas, and boat ramps.  Unpaved roads were lighter in tone than nearby vegetated features.  Paved roads ranged from light to dark gray in tone.  Roads usually had a smooth to slightly speckled texture.  Texture varied between road features, even on the same photo.  Road atlas maps and U.S.G.S. topographic maps were used to help define the major roads within the floodplain.  Unpaved roads and farm roads were identified visually and from the LiDAR data.   If the road feature was more than 3 pixels (3 meters) wide, it was digitized as a polygon.  If it was less than 3 pixels (3m) wide it was digitized as a line and then "buffered" in ArcMap with a 1.0m buffer to create a polygon with a width of 2 meters and a calculable area.</edomvd>

            <edomvd>Linear features that coincided with bridges (railroad crossings).  Road atlas and U.S.G.S. topographic maps were used to identify the railroads.  All digitized railroad features were more than 3 pixels (3m) wide and thus were digitized as polygons.  Tone of railroads was most often light gray to white because they are not vegetated, and texture was typically slightly speckled.  Differentiation between road and railroad features was based on road atlases and U.S.G.S. topographic maps.</edomvd>

            <edomv>DAM - Dam</edomv>
            <edomvd>A built feature most commonly constructed perpendicular to a water feature for the purpose of retention.  Aside from the Chiloquin Dam, all other dams within the floodplain are relatively small earthen dams related to water retention in irrigation systems on the floodplain.  Dam features were most often light or very light gray in tone.  Their texture ranged from smooth to slightly speckled, probably related to vegetation cover.  The irrigation dams have a very slight raised topography that is typically evident on the LiDAR data.</edomvd>

            <edomvd>A built feature that spans a water feature.  In contrast to a dam, a small bridge features does not impound water and typically was connected to a road or railroad.   Bridges were digitized as polygons.  Due to the variety of construction materials, Bridges ranged in tone from gray to white, and in texture from smooth to speckled.</edomvd>

            <edomv>LV - Levee</edomv>
            <edomvd>A built feature most commonly constructed parallel to or around a water feature.  Levees are linear ridges, and the relief was evident in the LiDAR data.  Levees were digitized as polygons.  Some Levees have roads on top.</edomvd>

            <edomv>ID - Irrigation Ditch</edomv>
            <edomvd>A built feature that is typically linear and represented as a depression on the LiDAR data.  In plan view, irrigation ditche features are often straight and sets of ditches are typically organized in a parallel or sub-parallel orientation.  Ditches may be wetted or dry, depending on irrigation timing relative to time of photograph. If wetted, the tone was dark gray to black and texture was smooth. If dry, the tone was speckled white to light gray, depending on vegetation cover.  If wetted this feature underlies irrigation water features in the water feature class. If the irrigation ditch feature was more than 3 pixels (3 meters) wide, it was digitized as a polygon.  If it was less than 3 pixels (3m) wide it was digitized as a line and then buffered in ArcMap with a 0.5m boundary to make a polygon with a width of 1 meter and a calculable area.  If dry, the feature was classified as Herbaceous vegetation.</edomvd>

            <edomv>BLD - Building</edomv>
            <edomvd>A built feature that is typically a square or rectangle, often a building has an elevated surface that was evident by shadowing. Tone and texture was highly variable depending on building materials.</edomvd>

            <edomv>OBF - Other built feature</edomv>
            <edomvd>Any other built feature within the defined floodplain boundary.  Old bridge pilings were attributed with "Other" in all three year sets.  Texture and tone varied.</edomvd>
