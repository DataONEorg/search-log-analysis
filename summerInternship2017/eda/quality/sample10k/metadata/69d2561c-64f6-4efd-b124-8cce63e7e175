      <abstract>This part of SIM 3302 presents data for the seafloor-character map (see sheet 5, SIM 3302) of the Offshore of Coal Oil Point map area, California. The raster data file is included in "SeafloorCharacter_OffshoreCoalOilPoint_5m.zip," which is accessible from http://pubs.usgs.gov/ds/781/OffshoreCoalOilPoint/data_catalog_OffshoreCoalOilPoint.html. These metadata describe the seafloor-character data collected at 5-m resolution. See "SeafloorCharacter_OffshoreCoalOilPoint_2m_metadata.txt" metadata for a description of the seafloor-character data collected at 2-m resolution.
The raster-format seafloor-character map shows five substrate classes of the Offshore of Coal Oil Point map area. The substrate classes mapped in this map area have been colored to indicate in which of the following California Marine Life Protection Act depth zones and slope classes they belong: Depth Zone 2 (intertidal to 30 m), Depth Zone 3 (30 to 100 m), Depth Zone 4 (100 to 200 m), Slope Class 1, 0 degrees to 5 degrees (flat), Slope Class 2, 5 degrees to 0 degrees (sloping), and Slope Class 3, 30 degrees to 60 degrees (steeply sloping).
Depth Zone 1 (intertidal), Depth Zone 5 (greater than 200 m), and Slope Classes 4 and 5, greater than 60 degrees (vertical to overhang) are not present in this map area. The map is created using a supervised classification method described by Cochrane (2008), available at http://doc.nprb.org/web/research/research%20pubs/615_habitat_mapping_workshop/Individual%20Chapters%20High-Res/Ch13%20Cochrane.pdf.
Bathymetry data were collected at two different resolutions: at 2-m resolution, down to approximately 80-m water depth (2006-2008 USGS data, and 2007 CSUMB data); and at 5-m resolution, in the deeper areas (2009 Fugro Pelagos data). The final resolution of the seafloor-character map is determined by the resolution of both the backscatter and bathymetry datasets; therefore, separate seafloor-character maps were generated to retain the maximum resolution of the source data.

        <procdesc>The seafloor-character map was produced using video-supervised maximum likelihood classification of the bathymetry and intensity of return from sonar systems. The classification was supervised using signatures defined by hand-drawn polygons located through sediment samples and video-observation ground truth surveying, applying methodology described in Cochrane (2008), available at http://doc.nprb.org/web/research/research%20pubs/615_habitat_mapping_workshop/Individual%20Chapters%20High-Res/Ch13%20Cochrane.pdf.
The two variants used in this classification were backscatter intensity and derivative rugosity. Rugosity measures terrain ruggedness as the variation in three-dimensional orientation of grid cells within a neighborhood. Vector analysis is used to calculate the dispersion of vectors normal (orthogonal) to grid cells within the specified neighborhood. This method effectively captures variability in slope and aspect into a single measure. Ruggedness values in the output raster map can range from 0 (no terrain variation) to 1 (complete terrain variation). The calculation was performed using the Terrain Ruggedness (VRM) tool (for details, see Sappington and others, 2007). Bathymetry data were collected at two different resolutions: at 2-m resolution, down to approximately 80-m water depth (2006-2008 USGS data, and 2007 CSUMB data); and at 5-m resolution, in the deeper areas (2009 Fugro Pelagos data). The final resolution of the seafloor-character map is determined by the resolution of both the backscatter and bathymetry datasets; therefore, separate seafloor-character maps were generated to retain the maximum resolution of the source data.
Classes I, II, and III were delineated using multivariate analysis. Class IV (rugged anthropogenic material) values are a subclass of seafloor Class III, and Class V (smooth, hard anthropogenic material) values are a subclass of Class II; these pixels were depicted on the basis of visual characteristics and known location of man-made features. The resulting map (gridded at 2 m) was cleaned by hand to remove data-collection artifacts (for example, trackline nadir). Editing was performed in Photoshop, with which individual pixels were selected and values adjusted to remove noise.  Selection occurred without antialiasing, and the resulting grid was identical but for the edited pixels.
The five seafloor classes mapped in this area were then colored to indicate in which of the following California Marine Life Protection Act depth zones and slope classes they belong: Depth Zone 2 (intertidal to 30 m); Depth Zone 3 (30 to 100 m); Depth Zone 4 (100 to 200 m); Slope Class 1, 0 degrees to 5 degrees (flat); Slope Class 2, 5 degrees to 30 degrees sloping); or Slope Class 3, 30 degrees to 60 degrees (steeply sloping). Depth Zone 1 (intertidal), Depth Zone 5 (greater than 200 m), and Slopes Classes 4 and 5, greater than 60 degrees (vertical to overhang) are not present in this map area.</procdesc>
