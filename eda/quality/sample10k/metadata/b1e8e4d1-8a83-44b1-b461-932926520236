      <supplinf>Introduction --

This data set consists of digital polygons of a constant
recharge value for the alluvial and terrace deposits along the
North Canadian River from Canton Lake to Lake Overholser in
central Oklahoma. Ground water in approximately 400 square miles
of Quaternary-age alluvial and terrace aquifer is an important
source of water for irrigation, industrial, municipal, stock,
and domestic supplies. The aquifer consists of clay, silt,
sand, and gravel. Sand-sized sediments dominate the poorly
sorted, fine to coarse, unconsolidated quartz grains in the
aquifer. The hydraulically connected alluvial and terrace
deposits unconformably overlie Permian-age formations. The
aquifer is overlain by a layer of wind-blown sand in parts of
the area (Christenson, 1983).

A uniform recharge rate of 1 inch per year was used as input to
the ground-water flow model for the aquifer and is used in this
data set.

A uniform recharge rate of 1 inch per year is used in this data
set for the alluvial and terrace deposits. This value was
determined by Christenson (1983, page 18) during the calibration
of a steady-state ground-water flow model of the alluvial and
terrace deposits. A value of -99999 indicates the recharge is
not known.

Digital Line Graph (DLG) format requires numbers to be stored as
integers. Therefore, the recharge in inches per year was
multiplied by 100 and stored in the digital data sets as
hundredths of inches per year. For example 1.0 inches per year
was multiplied by 100 and stored in the digital data sets as 100
in hundredths of an inch per year.

Features representing boundaries along geological contacts were
extracted from digital geology data sets by Cederstrand (1996a,
1996b, 1996c) based on a scale of 1:250,000. Boundaries defining
the northwest and southeast geographic limits of the aquifer
were digitized from a folded paper map in the ground-water
modeling report, "Numerical simulation of the alluvium and
terrace aquifer along the North Canadian River from Canton Lake
to Lake Overholser, central Oklahoma," by Christenson (1983,
plate 6), at a scale of 1:250,000.

Ground-water flow models are numerical representations that
simplify and aggregate natural systems. Models are not unique;
different combinations of aquifer characteristics may produce
similar results. The hydraulic conductivity and recharge are
closely interrelated. As long as these two model inputs are
in balance the model has a small mean residual; it represents
the natural system numerically. If the hydraulic conductivity is
accurately known, the model can be used to accurately determine
recharge. Likewise, if the hydraulic conductivity is poorly
known, then the recharge will be poorly determined.

Therefore, values of recharge used in the model and presented
in this data set are not precise, but are within a reasonable
range when compared to independently collected data. Recharge
probably varies considerably over the local area, and model
recharge is at best an average over an area at least as large
as the model grid (and probably much larger than a single
cell).

Reviews Applied to Data --

This electronic report was subjected to the same review standard
that applies to all U.S. Geological Survey reports. Reviewers
were asked to check the topological consistency, tolerances,
attribute frequencies and statistics, projection, and geographic
extent. Reviewers were given digital data sets and paper plots
for checking against the source maps to verify the linework and
attributes. The reviewers checked the metadata and a_readme.1st
files for completeness and accuracy.

Related Spatial and Tabular Data Sets --

This data set is one of four digital map data sets being published
together for this aquifer. The four data sets are:

&gt;              aqbound -  aquifer boundaries

&gt;              cond    -  hydraulic conductivity

&gt;              recharg -  aquifer recharge

&gt;              wlelev  -  water-level elevation contours

Digital map data sets of the Oklahoma surficial geology
digitized from 1:250,000-scale maps (or 1:125,000-scale maps for
the three Oklahoma panhandle counties) are published separately.

    <useconst>Features representing geological contacts were extracted digital
geology data sets by Cederstrand (1996a, 1996b, 1996c), based on a
scale of 1:250,000. Lines defining the geographic limits of the
aquifer were digitized from a folded paper map (19 inches by 17
inches) at a scale of 1:250,000 (Christenson, 1983, pl. 6). The
lines that were digitized had a maximum root-mean-squared-error
(RMSE) of 0.008 map inches (0.020 map centimeters) or 169.03 feet
(51.52 meters) ground distance. Recharge polygons represented at
these scales are indicative of broad, regional trends and should
not be interpreted as site specific.

Ground-water flow models are numerical representations that
simplify and aggregate natural systems. Models are not unique;
different combinations of aquifer characteristics may produce
similar results. The hydraulic conductivity and recharge are
closely interrelated. As long as these two model inputs are
in balance the model has a small mean residual; it represents the

        <procdesc>Features representing boundaries along geological contacts
were extracted from digital geology data sets by Cederstrand
(1996a, 1996b, 1996c) using the ARC/INFO GET command. The
ARC/INFO CLEAN command (ESRI, 1995), was used with a dangle
length of 0.0 feet or meters and fuzzy tolerance of 32.8
feet (10.0 meters). ARC/INFO PROJECT command (ESRI, 1995) was
used to convert the report data set projection from Albers
Conical Equal Area to Universal Transverse Mercator-Zone 14.

Boundaries defining the northwest and southeast geographic
limits of the aquifer were digitized from a folded paper map,
at a scale of 1:250,000. The map was based on Transverse
Mercator projection, with central meridians of 99 and 97
degrees west longitude.

Nine registration tics, located at township and range corners,
were projected into Universal Transverse Mercator-Zone 14 the
projection used for manual digitizing. The boundaries were
digitized in one session with a maximum registration
root-mean-squared error (RMSE) of 0.008 inches map (0.020
centimeters) map distance or 169.03 feet (51.52 meters) ground
distance.

The data set was edited to delete extraneous pseudo and dangle
nodes. The ARC/INFO CLEAN command (ESRI, 1995) was used with
dangle length of 1000.0 meters and fuzzy tolerance of 328.1
feet (100.0 meters).

In the initial digitizing, the registration tics used were
township and range corners taken from 1:24,000-scale
topographic maps. A comparison of a paper plot of the report
data set with the source map showed that the corners used as
registration tics were not in the same locations on the
1:250,000-scale aquifer map. To correct the problem, three
1:250,000-scale U.S. Geological Survey quadrangle maps were
registered using latitudinal and longitudinal registration
tics, with a maximum registration root-mean-squared-error
(RMSE) of 0.008 inches (0.020 centimeters) map distance or
190.22 feet (57.98 meters) ground distance. Twenty-seven
registration tics were selected and digitized from the
quadrangle maps, and given the same tic identification numbers
as the tics that were used initially. These new tics were used
with the ARC/INFO TRANSFORM command (ESRI, 1995) to adjust the
digitized lines to more closely match the source map. The
root-mean-squared-error (RMSE) for TRANSFORM was 189.3 feet
(57.7 meters) ground distance. The ARC/INFO PROJECT command
(ESRI, 1995) was used to convert the data set projection from
Universal Transverse Mercator-Zone 14 to Transverse Mercator,
with central meridians of 99 and 97 degrees west longitude. A
comparison of this transformed data set to the pretransformed
data set showed no difference in the digitized polygon
boundaries.

The ARC/INFO CLEAN command (ESRI, 1995) was used with a dangle
length of 0.0 feet or meters and fuzzy tolerance of 32.8 feet
(10.0 meters). Polygons were attributed for R and lines were
attributed for LSOURCE. Verification of attribute codes were
made by comparing a paper plot of the data set with the source
map. The ARC/INFO PROJECT command (ESRI, 1995) was used to
convert the report data set projection to Albers Conical Equal
Area.

    <overview>
      <eaover>Each polygon in this data set has an associated attribute, R,
containing recharge values expressed in hundredths of an inch
per year. The recharge value of 1.00 inch per year is stored as
an R value of 100. The number -99999 indicates the recharge
value is unknown. R is stored in the first major code (MAJOR1)
for polygons, and 0 is stored in the first minor code (MINOR1)
in the Digital Line Graph (DLG) version of this data set.

Each line in this digital data set has an associated attribute,
LSOURCE, that contains a code to indicate the line source. An
LSOURCE code of 1 indicates the line was digitized from
Christenson (1983), and an LSOURCE code of 2 indicates the line
was extracted from Cederstrand (1996a, 1996b, 1996c). LSOURCE is
stored in the first major code (MAJOR1) for lines, and 0 is
stored in the first minor code MINOR1) in the Digital Line Graph
(DLG) version of this data set.
