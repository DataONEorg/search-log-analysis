    <descript>
      <abstract>Atlantic coast piping plover (Charadrius melodus) nest sites are typically found on low-lying beach and dune systems, which respond rapidly to coastal processes like sediment overwash, inlet formation, and island migration that are sensitive to climate-related changes in storminess and the rate of sea-level rise. Data were obtained to understand piping plover habitat distribution and use along their Atlantic Coast breeding range. A smartphone application called iPlover was developed to collect standardized data on habitat characteristics at piping plover nest locations. The application capitalized on a network of trained monitors that observe piping plovers throughout their U.S. Atlantic coast breeding range as part of the species’ recovery plan. Monitors used iPlover to document nest locations as well as randomly distributed points at beaches and barrier islands over ~1500 km of coast between Maine and North Carolina, USA. This work is one component of a larger research and management program that seeks to understand and sustain ecological value, ecosystem services, and habitat suitability of beaches in the face of storm impacts, climate change, and sea-level rise. Tabular digital data generated by field data collection with iPlover with accompanying site photographs in JPEG format are presented in this data release.</abstract>

    <attracc>
      <attraccr>iPlover users selected attributes for Geomorphic Setting, Substrate Type, Vegetation Type, and Vegetation Density that best characterized each nest or random point location. As such, there may be some variation in the assessment of a category between individual users. The reliability of the user-chosen classification was estimated as described below.

The accuracy of the classifications of Geomorphic Setting, Substrate Type, Vegetation Type, and Vegetation Density was evaluated using the classification of four subject-matter experts as validation (Thieler and others, 2016). The expert validation was performed on a 10 percent random sample of points collected using iPlover in both 2014 and 2015 (k = 181, n = 1799). Values in the 2014 dataset were reclassified to 2015 values to reflect changes in the classification scheme for the 2015 version of the application that provided greater specificity and conformance with biogeomorphic nomenclature. The reclassification process is described in the Process Steps and the reclassified values are included in the last four attribute columns of the table.

Subject-matter experts used the photograph and geolocation of each sample point to assign the biogeomorphic classification (across all four variables) using 2015 classification values. Experts were selected based on their experience and history of relevant publications on the geology and geomorphology of coastal environments in the study domain, as well as demonstrated expertise in the interpretation of remotely sensed data. Truth values for each sample point were selected according to expert consensus. 

The following percentages indicate the agreement between expert consensus and field user classification for all test points for which expert consensus could be determined: 58% for geomorphic setting (90 agreeing points out of 156 truth), 80% for substrate type (121 out of 151), 84% for vegetation type (141 out of 167), and 77% for vegetation density (118 out of 153) (see Table 2 and Supplemental Table 2 in Thieler and others, 2016). Of the 181 locations, an expert consensus could be reach in 151, 167, and 153 cases for substrate type, vegetation type, and vegetation density respectively. Systematic errors were more common for the substrate and vegetation variables compared to Geomorphic Setting (Table 3 in Thieler and others, 2016). What experts classified as Sand was frequently classified as Shell/Gravel/Cobble by iPlover field users and vice versa, accounting for 86% of the differences in this variable. Vegetation Type was frequently classified as Herbaceous by experts and as None by iPlover users and vice versa, accounting for 81% of the differences for this habitat variable. Finally, the most frequent differences in Vegetation Density were between None and Sparse (51% of differences) and between Sparse and Moderate (23%; Table 3 in Thieler and others, 2016). The most common differences between the classifications of iPlover field users and experts occurred at the "boundaries" of categorical habitat characteristics. For example, what some experts classified as Backshore, other experts and the field user classified as Beach. If an obvious wrackline or geomorphic feature such as a berm was not visible to separate these two geomorphic settings, points that fell between the ocean and the dune toe could be reasonably characterized as either Beach or Backshore. Experts and iPlover field users also disagreed frequently over whether a point fell in no vegetation or sparse vegetation or whether a point fell within sparse or moderate vegetation cover. Experts and iPlover field users were instructed to visually estimate vegetation density and did not use field-based techniques such as quadrat sampling to quantify density. Therefore, differences in classifications between experts and iPlover field users would be expected in places where vegetation density was close to 20%, separating Sparse from Moderate vegetation, or close to 90%, separating Moderate from Dense vegetation.</attraccr>

      <horizpa>
        <horizpar>Positional accuracy was estimated by comparing the smartphone geolocation data to that collected by a SpectraPrecision SP80 GNSS receiver at 44 piping plover nest points in Virginia and Massachusetts. We determined the horizontal difference between the geolocation data obtained from iPlover (i.e., the smartphone’s built-in geolocation functionality; Table 1 in Thieler and others, 2016) with high-resolution nest location data collected with the GNSS receiver. Smartphones from 2008 to present (2016) (beginning with the 3G iPhone) use a hybrid positioning system that combines A-GPS, Wi-Fi, and cellular positioning methods that are generally accurate within 3-8 m (Zandbergen 2009; Boccardo et al. 2015). GNSS data consist of a combination of real-time kinematic and post-processed positions that are accurate within 3±2 cm in the horizontal. GNSS data are thus two orders of magnitude more accurate than average smartphone GPS data, so we were able to evaluate smartphone accuracy easily. The differences in x (0.3 +/- 4.4 m) and y (0.08 +/- 5.7 m) UTM coordinates of the smartphone and GNSS locations are nearly distributed around zero. The average difference between the GNSS points and the smartphones was 5.8 +/- 4.2 m. We did not find spatial variability in accuracy from site to site. For one site where we had repeated measurements at different times on the same day, the difference in geolocation was well within the error reported here.
The ‘accuracy’ attribute indicates the location accuracy reported by geolocation application program interface (API). These values tend to be imprecise.

        <procdesc>Data were collected in the field with the iPlover smartphone application. iPlover data were collected during the breeding season (~April-August) in 2015.

Prior to field collection, all data collectors participated in a training seminar and were given written protocols (https://github.com/usgs/iplover/blob/master/iPloverUserGuide.pdf). Users recorded (i) information on the habitat characteristics at a given location, (ii) images of the habitat, and (iii) spatial coordinates of the location of either a piping plover nest or a random point. 

Users logged two types of sites: nest sites and random points. The nest sites were identified by users in the course of monitoring efforts. Random point locations were randomly generated and sent to data collectors by Sara L. Zeigler. Random point generation was constrained by the boundaries of pre-determined sub-sites. These boundaries usually were defined by the terrestrial extent of a barrier island. Random points were collected to represent unsuitable biogeomorphic characteristics. If the user could not access the location for a random point, the values were determined by Sara L. Zeigler using available remotely sensed data and subsequently verified in the field. This manual entry occurred outside of the database and thus did not record values for 'id', 'datetime' nor 'accuracy'.

Once at the site, users logged a data point by selecting ‘Log a Nest Site’ within iPlover, version 2.0 (Figure 5 in Thieler and others, 2016). This opened a field survey page where they 1) logged the geolocation, date, and time, 2) took a photograph, and 3) categorized the biogeomorphology of the site. To log the geolocation, date, and time, they held the mobile device directly over the site and selected lock location, at which point the app recorded the geolocation coordinates, date, and time detected by the device’s internal sensors. They next stepped 5 m away from the site to take a photograph using the device’s built-in camera. Next, the user manually completed a simple habitat assessment according to a fixed set of variables and their potential categorical values listed in iPlover. Users were instructed to base their habitat assessment on the area within a 5x5 m area containing the nest site at its center. Users assigned a value for each of the four habitat variables - Geomorphic Setting, Substrate Type, Vegetation Type, and Vegetation Density – by selecting a radio button (Figure 5 in Thieler and others, 2016). Users typed a site identification and notes in free text fields. iPlover records were locally stored on smartphones while users were in the field.  iPlover records were locally stored on smartphones while users were in the field. Once an Internet connection was available, users uploaded locally-stored records to a central PostgreSQL (version 9.4) database. 

The data first passed through a Java parser on a server at the USGS EROS Data Center that converted the JSON data produced by the iPlover application into insert statements that are used against the PostgreSQL (version 9.4) table. The photos were uploaded to a separate server with greater storage capacity (Amazon Web Services S3 bucket). Most photographs uploaded through the application did not retain EXIF data because of the privacy practices of the individual users or the mobile operating systems.</procdesc>
        <procdate>20150402</procdate>
      </procstep>
      <procstep>
        <procdesc>At the end of the field collection season, the PostgreSQL (version 9.4) 'entries' table was exported into a comma-separated values (CSV) file. The photos were downloaded from the cloud server. The table was manipulated as a DataFrame object in the Scientific PYthon Development EnviRonment (Spyder, version 2.3.9) and saved as a CSV as follows: 

1) Attributes that were of no further use were removed, i.e. ‘altitude’, ‘altaccuracy’, ‘notes’, and ‘deleted’. Altitude and the associated altitude accuracy had no relationship to the data because they were logged with a highly imprecise mobile device. 

2) The attribute 'imagefile' was created and populated by concatenating the value for the ‘id’ attribute with the ‘.jpg’ extension. The image filenames from the 'imagefile' attribute were checked against the existing image files; when an image file listed in 'imagefile' did not exist, the value was replaced with ‘MISSING’. Fifteen photos were removed for privacy concerns. Photos that were removed are indicated with the text ’REMOVED’ in the ‘imagefile’ attribute. 

3) Any rows that did not record a unique piping plover nest site or random point were removed. These included records used for various tests, records of American oystercatcher nest sites, and records of duplicate sites. These points were identified using values in the collectiongroup, location and notes attributes and by viewing the photos. For example, all records for which the notes attribute value indicated that the record was logged as a test were eliminated. 

Faces of individuals were blurred in three photos (c8ec1f95-6ad5-4a6e-8668-948de18eb4c8.jpg, a590a814-1f99-4a9d-be62-502fcfc8a51c.jpg, and 4b7336bc-186a-4250-b5f7-6b9ed30b5239.jpg) using a 20 pixel Field Blur filter to an area manually delineated with the Lasso tool in Adobe PhotoShop CS6 Version 13.0.6 x64.</procdesc>

        <procdesc>When iPlover was updated between 2014 and 2015, choices used for the various biogeomorphic state classifications were reorganized, modified, and added to better reflect characteristics observed in the field. To enable analysis of the combined datasets, values logged in 2014 were reclassified to the choices used in 2015. The coded values from 2015 were also reclassified to a standard domain. The reclassified values are included in the last four attribute columns of the table, indicated by attribute names with the suffix “_2.” 

The reclassification was performed using the following reclassification table developed by Sara L. Zeigler. In the first column are values recorded by iPlover based on user choices and columns 2–5 indicate the reclassification to standard values for each biogeomorphic variable.

        <procdesc>EXIF data for the photographs were populated using the ASCII table of field collection data. This was necessary because most photographs uploaded through the application did not include EXIF data. The lack of EXIF data was caused by privacy practices of the users or the mobile operating systems. 

Attribute formatting was modified in Microsoft Excel for Mac OS (version 14.6.6) to match the requirements for EXIF data: The ‘datetime’ attribute was split into two attributes: ‘date’ and ‘time’ with all formatting removed. The attributes and final formatting was as follows: id = unique-id-string.jpg; lat = DD.dddddd; lon = -DD.dddddd; time = hhmmss; date = YYYYMMDD. A Python (version 2.7.3) script (write_exif_ejs.py) was then run that incorporated this information, along with additional information, into the appropriate locations in the EXIF header of each full-resolution JPEG image. The PYTHON script uses ExifTool (version 9.4.6.0) to write the information to the image headers of the full-resolution images. 
        The following tags were populated in the JPEG image headers. Information is duplicated in some tags. This was done because different software packages access different tags.
        GPS tags: The values populated are unique for each image and based on the information exported from the iplover_fieldpts_2014.csv file. These positions and time actually represent when the data was recorded in the iPlover app, which should be 5 m and a few seconds offset from the location and time at which the photograph was actually taken according to standard iPlover data collection.

JPEG tags: The tag is listed along with the information used to populate it - which is the same for every image taken.

To extract the information from the image headers using ExifTool, the following command can be used (tested with ExifTool version 9.4.6.0):
exiftool.exe -csv -f -filename -GPSTimeStamp -GPSLongitude -GPSLatitude -n -Artist -Credit -comment –Contact -keywords -Caption -Copyright -CopyrightNotice -Caption-Abstract -ImageDescription *.jpg &gt; out.csv
The -csv flag writes the information out in a comma-delimited format. The -n option formats the latitude and longitude as signed decimal degrees.</procdesc>
