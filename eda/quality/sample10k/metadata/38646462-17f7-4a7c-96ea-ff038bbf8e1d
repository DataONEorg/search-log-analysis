      <abstract>These data were collected under a cooperative agreement with the Massachusetts Office of Coastal Zone Management (CZM) and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), Coastal and Marine Geology Program, Woods Hole Science Center (WHSC). Initiated in 2003, the primary objective of this program is to develop regional geologic framework information for the management of coastal and marine resources. Accurate data and maps of sea-floor geology are important first steps toward protecting fish habitat, delineating marine resources, and assessing environmental changes due to natural or human impacts. The project is focused on the inshore waters (5-30 m deep) of Massachusetts between the New Hampshire border and Cape Cod Bay. Data collected for the mapping cooperative have been released in a series of USGS Open-File Reports (http://woodshole.er.usgs.gov/project-pages/coastal_mass/html/current_map.html). This spatial dataset is from the study area located between Duxbury and Hull Massachusetts, and consists of high-resolution geophysics (bathymetry, backscatter intensity, and seismic reflection) and ground validation (sediment samples, video tracklines and bottom photographs). The data were collected during four separate surveys conducted between 2003 and 2007 (NOAA survey H10993 in 2003, USGS-WHSC survey 06012 in 2006, and USGS-WHSC surveys 07001 and 07003 in 2007) and cover more than 200 square kilometers of the inner continental shelf.</abstract>
      <purpose>This GeoTIFF (Tagged Image File Format) contains approximately 186 square-km of Klein 3000 sidescan-sonar data that were collected by the U.S. Geological Survey during two surveys (USGS surveys 06012 and 07001) offshore of Massachusetts, between Duxbury and Hull.  These data are used to define the sea-floor morphology as part of the Massachusetts Sea-floor Mapping Project.</purpose>

    <logic>This image represents mainline sidescan sonar data; no crossline data were included in this image.  Gaps may occur along-track and between adjacent lines.</logic>
    <complete>Only the subset of sidescan-sonar backscatter data collected during field activities 06012 and 07001 that are within the study area between Duxbury and Hull have been included in this spatial dataset.  Approximately 125 square-km of additional sidescan-sonar backscatter data were collected south of Brant Rock, Massachusetts during these field activities will be published in a subsequent data release focused on Cape Cod Bay.  Some sections of sonar data with excess noise were clipped during processing.</complete>

        <horizpar>Field activity 06012: The Klein 3000 was towed from the stern A-frame of the R/V Megan T. Miller.  Position data were provided by the Z-Surveyor Extreme for real-time kinematic (RTK) navigation and recorded to the raw data files (XTF) via SonarPro (version 9.6) on the sonar acquisition computer.  During some portions of the survey, technical difficulties caused the GPS systems to malfunction; in some instances the acquisition systems fell back on the RTK Float or the autonomous GPS navigation; but in some cases surveying was halted until a reliable GPS signal could be achieved.  Layback positions, which account for the linear distance between the shipboard RTK-GPS receiver and the towed sonar vehicle were measured by a cable counter on the winch that was used to deploy the sidescan-sonar towfish.  Layback offsets were directly applied into the acquisition software so the navigation recorded in the XTF data reflect the position including the layback offset.  A conservative estimate of positional accuracy is estimated to be 10 m although when the system was recording RTK navigation the positional accuracy is likely &lt;1 m as RTK-GPS provides horizontal positional accuracies on the decimeter scale.  Positional uncertainty arises because the layback calculations do not account for fish motion behind the vessel, which is caused by sea state and vessel speed induced changes in the angle and scope of the tow cable.

Field activity 07001:  The Klein 3000 was towed from the port side aft on the R/V Rafael.  Position data were provided by the Ashtech Extreme for real-time kinematic (RTK) navigation and recorded to the raw data files (XTF) via SonarPro (version 10.0) on the sonar acquisition computer.  A conservative estimate of positional accuracy is estimated to be 10 m although when the system was recording RTK navigation the positional accuracy is likely &lt;1 m as RTK-GPS provides horizontal positional accuracies on the decimeter scale. Layback was fixed and figured into the navigation during acquisition.</horizpar>
        <qhorizpa>
          <horizpav>10 meters</horizpav>
          <horizpae>The RTK-GPS is accurate to &lt;1 meter, however, the layback of the towfish adds additional uncertainty due to changes in angle and scope of the tow cable in response to sea state and vessel speed.  Therefore, a conservative estimate of the positional accuracy of this system is estimated to be approximately 10 meters.</horizpae>

        <procdesc>Data acquisition at sea:
Sidescan sonar data were collected with a Klein 3000 dual frequency (132/445 kHz) sidescan sonar towfish on the R/V Megan T. Miller (06012) and the R/V Rafael (07001).  During survey 06012 the sonar was towed from the stern A-frame of the R/V Megan T. Miller; a cable counter measured the towfish layback and automatically adjusted the layback parameter in the acquisition software (SonarPro version 9.6).  During survey 07001, the sonar was towed from the port side aft on the R/V Rafael; layback was fixed and SonarPro version 10.0 was used on the acquisition computer. Tracklines are generally spaced 100m apart (200m in the northern area where the USGS data overlaps with NOAA multibeam echo-sounder data).  Data were acquired roughly parallel to the shoreline at an average speed of 5 knots.</procdesc>

      <procstep>
        <procdesc>Within XSonar Software (version: 1.1) a median filtering routine (4 pixels across track by 3 pixels along track) was applied to the raw sidescan-sonar data (XTF) to remove speckle noise. The data were further processed to correct for fish altitude, slant and beam artifacts, and then merged with the navigation (Danforth, 1997). Adjacent sidescan sonar lines were mapped out separately from XSonar into north-heading and south-heading sonar mosaics at 1 meter/pixel resolution. Sidescan areas were defined within the survey trackline planning scheme such that the sonar images mapped in XSonar would have the same line orientation and keep the working mosaics to a manageable filesize.</procdesc>

        <procdesc>A PCI Geomatica (version: 10.0.3) project was created for each subarea of the Duxbury to Hull survey area.  The north and south-heading working mosaics were imported into PCI Geomatica to be digitally mosaicked together using PCI's OrthoEngine and procedures described in Paskevich (1996) and Paskevich and others (Unpublished, 2007). The mosaicking process produces an enhanced, geographically correct, sidescan-sonar mosaic with 1 meter/pixel resolution. The subareas were tone-adjusted within PCI's OrthoEngine mosaicking tools (to account for tonal-variation as a result of changes to the acquisition parameters or variations introduced as a result of processing); then mosaicked together into a composite backscatter image for the entire survey area.  The composite mosaic was exported as a GeoTIFF image.</procdesc>

        <procdesc>Most of the NODATA area in the GeoTIFF image (outside the survey bounds) have a backscatter pixel value of 255.  But as a result of the mosaicking process, some areas of NODATA have a backscatter pixel value of 254.  Using Adobe Photoshop CS2 (version 9.0.2), all of the NODATA areas were selected and made to have a single NODATA value, such that all NODATA in the final mosaic will have a pixel value of 255. All backscatter data within the survey area have a value of &lt;255, although some small data gaps (NODATA) do occur within the survey area as well.  A two-pixel median filter was applied to TIFF image to eliminate speckle noise in the final mosaic and small gaps of &lt; 1 meter.</procdesc>
