      <abstract>Pulley Ridge is a series of drowned barrier islands that extends almost 200 km in 60-100 m water depths. This drowned ridge is located on the Florida Platform in the southeastern Gulf of Mexico about 250 km west of Cape Sable, Florida. This barrier island chain formed during the initial stage of the Holocene marine transgression. These islands were then submerged and left abandoned near the outer edge of the Florida Platform. The southern portion of Pulley Ridge hosts zooxanthellate scleractinian corals, green, red and brown macro algae, and a mix of deep and typically shallow-water tropical fishes. This reef community is in unusually deep water, and its extent and the controls on its distribution were unknown. To address these questions scientists from the U.S. Geological Survey Coastal and Marine Geology Program in cooperation with scientists from the University of South Florida Department of Marine Sciences have completed a detailed mapping of the southernmost 35 km of Pulley Ridge. The area was mapped using multibeam bathymetry, sidescan-sonar imagery, and high-resolution seismic-reflection profiling to define the geologic framework on which the reef is established. Submersible dives, remotely operated vehicle (ROV) transects, and transects of bottom photographs and video were collected to identify the corals and to map their distribution. This extensive suite of data has been compiled and preliminary analysis of the data suggests that the reefs are not tied to the ridge system, but instead are more broadly distributed. Whether reef distribution is controlled by oceanographic conditions or by subtle differences in the substrate that overlies the barrier island system is unclear, and are topics of continued research.</abstract>
      <purpose>To provide high-resolution bathymetry for the Pulley Ridge study area.</purpose>

        <procdesc>All raw data files were processed with CARIS HIPS (Hydrographic Information Processing System) version 5.3 with the following workflow: a) created vessel configuration file (VCF) for each cruise. Initial roll, yaw, pitch, and x,y,z axis parameters were set to zero. This information was incorporated into the data at the time of collection as the installation parameters.  b) created a new project directory for the HIPS data. This data set was broken down by year. The 2000 data was added to the 1999 data and made into one project, but the other years each have their own projects and field sheets.  c) raw line files from em3000 software were brought into CARIS conversion wizard. The conversion wizard converts raw data files to HIPS format and saves the files to a project directory.  d) each line was evaluated with the navigation editor to clean the vessel's navigation data. Two know jumps in speed were searched for and the position fixes along with the fixes before and after were rejected with interpolation. The lines were also evaluated with attitude editor to view and clean the motion sensor data like heave and roll. e) a tide file was created for each cruise using a model created by Ruoying He in the Ocean Circulation Group at the Univ. of South Florida (see cross reference section for reference). f) All lines were then merged to create position/depth data for each sounding. g) filters were created for each survey and set to: min depth 40 m, max depth 115 m (as requested by researchers), nadir depth 3.2, angle form nadir 65 degrees port and starboard. Filters applied after merging. h) after merging a weighted mean seabed surface (grid) was created at a 5 m resolution. i) ran the statistical surface cleaning. Cleaning by 2 standard deviation 95%, polynomial 1: tilted plane, tile bugger 10%. j) created subset tiles of 500 square meters. Each tile was opened in subset editor to examine and clean soundings in both 2D and 3D. Tiles viewed in subset editor reveal when calibration is necessary or if there is a sound velocity error.  k) if needed, a subset was examined with the calibration function to measure parameters like transducer mounting offsets (pitch, roll, heading). The calibration surveys were performed and allowed adjustments of the survey data parameters and modifications were written to the VCF. Survey modifications were as follows: 2000 survey - VCF for both days adjusted to yaw -9.0 and roll 0.35. 2001 survey - VCF for day 249 (9/6/01) adjusted roll to -0.25, for the day 251 adjusted roll to -0.35.  2003 survey: VCF for days 114, 115, and 119 adjusted to delta z +3.5m, for days 114 and 115 roll adjustment to -0.40. l) after adjusting the VCF files all associated lines for each survey were remerged and then regridded. m) grids were exported to x,y,z using the weighted grid to ASCII option selected units of geographic decimal degrees (DD).  Five files were exported: PR_00_99_5m.xyz, PR_01_5m.xyz, PR_03_5m.xyz, PR_sw_03_5m.xyz, and PR_gapfill_5m.xyz.</procdesc>
