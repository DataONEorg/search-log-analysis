            <othercit>Each downloadable multi-zone image layer (see: https://water.usgs.gov/GIS/browse/nlcd01-multizones.jpg) is comprised of merged multiple-mapping zones (see: https://water.usgs.gov/GIS/browse/nlcd01-mappingzones.jpg). Each mapping zone has its own metadata that can be found in the appropriate mapping-zone metadata directory that is created when the downloaded multizone file is decompressed. The metadata for mapping zone 01 would be located under the directory area1_landcover_metatdata\zone1_landcov_meta_web_final (area1 is the same as Multi zone 1 and zone1 is mapping zone 01). The organization of multi zones and mapping zones for TILE 4 is as follows: Multi zone 9 contains mapping zones 38, 43, 44; Multi zone 10 contains mapping zones 32, 35, 36, 37a, 37b; Multi zone 11 contains mapping zones 47, 49, 52, 53, 62; Multi zone 12 contains mapping zones 37b, 45, 46a, 46b, 48; Multi zone 13 contains mapping zones 60, 61; Multi zone 14 contains mapping zones 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59.</othercit>

      <abstract>This 30-meter data set represents land use and land cover for the conterminous United States for the 2001 time period. The data have been arranged into four tiles to facilitate timely display and manipulation within a Geographic Information System (see https://water.usgs.gov/GIS/browse/nlcd01-partition.jpg).
The National Land Cover Data Set for 2001 was produced through a cooperative project conducted by the Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics (MRLC) Consortium. The MRLC Consortium is a partnership of Federal agencies (http://www.mrlc.gov), consisting of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the U.S. Forest Service (USFS), the National Park Service (NPS), the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), and the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). One of the primary goals of the project is to generate a current, consistent, seamless, and accurate National Land Cover Database (NLCD) circa 2001 for the United States at medium spatial resolution. For a detailed definition and discussion on MRLC and the NLCD 2001 products, refer to Homer and others (2004), (see: http://www.mrlc.gov/mrlc2k.asp).

The NLCD 2001 was created by partitioning the United States into mapping zones. A total of 68 mapping zones (see https://water.usgs.gov/GIS/browse/nlcd01-mappingzones.jpg), were delineated within the conterminous United States based on ecoregion and geographical characteristics, edge-matching features, and the size requirement of Landsat mosaics. Mapping zones encompass the whole or parts of several states. Questions about the NLCD mapping zones can be directed to the NLCD 2001 Land Cover Mapping Team at the USGS/EROS, Sioux Falls, SD (605) 594-6151 or mrlc@usgs.gov.</abstract>
      <purpose>To provide complete, current, and consistent public domain information of national land use and land cover. This national (conterminous United States) data set was developed for use by the NAWQA (National Water-Quality Assessment) Program. NAWQA uses land-use data to assess land-use change, such as urban development and loss of agricultural lands as well as to allocate nutrient and pesticide loads to particular land-use categories.</purpose>
      <supplinf>The data is stored in four tiles (NLCD01_1, NLCD01_2, NLCD01_3, NLCD01_4) (see https://water.usgs.gov/GIS/browse/nlcd01-partitions.jpg), to allow for storage using the ArcInfo Workstation GRID data model, which cannot support files larger than 2.1 gigabytes. Each tile has been stored as a gzipped ARCTAR file. To extract the ArcInfo Workstation GRID from the .tgz archive file use WINZIP, TARARC, or the following commands: gunzip &lt;tilename&gt;.tgz then tar xvof &lt;tilename&gt;.tar

Questions about the NLCD mapping of any zone can be directed to the NLCD 2001 Land Cover Mapping Team at the USGS/EROS, Sioux Falls, SD (605) 594-6151 or mrlc@usgs.gov.</supplinf>

    <useconst>From the USGS Land Cover Institute (LCI) site http://landcover.usgs.gov/faq.php:
Direct comparison with NLCD 1992 is not recommended. Each data set was mapped with different methods and slightly different classes. While the two NLCD products are designed to be similar, the slight differences in classification, combined with the final accuracy of the mapping (from 70-80%), result in two distinct products. The typical result of direct comparison will result in a change map showing differences between mapping methods rather than real change on the ground. The NLCD mapping team is completing a product that highlights areas of potential change between the two eras of land cover using the original Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery. This product will soon be available on the web site for areas of completed land cover.

Users should refer to the metadata for each mapping zone for use constraints that may be unique to each zone.</useconst>

        <procdesc>Multi-zone zipped image files were downloaded from the MRLC multi-zone web site &lt;http://www.mrlc.gov/index.asp&gt; on May 21, 2007. Image header files were then built partly based on the format supplied by the USGS LCI (Land Cover Institute) from the web site &lt;http://landcover.usgs.gov/faq.php&gt;; the exact parameters are shown below. Left longitude and top latitude extents were obtained for each image by reading the source information in ArcGIS. Images were then converted to raster data sets using the IMAGEGRID command in Arc workstation. The command PROJECTDEFINE was then applied to each multi-zone grid for proper display and projection definition. The resulting raster data sets were then merged together using the national tile configuration previously established by NAWQA for NLCD, NLCDe, and NLCDeP. Tiles were assembled by using the SETWINDOW command with the NAWQA tiles as SNAP grids for proper alignment with the other national data sets.
******************************************************************************************
Tile 1 contains all or parts of the following Multi zones and their respective mapping zones.

Multi zone 1: mapping zones 01, 02, 07, 08, 09;
