      <abstract>These data were collected under a cooperative agreement between the Massachusetts Office of Coastal Zone Management (CZM) and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), Coastal and Marine Geology Program, Woods Hole Coastal and Marine Science Center (WHCMSC). Initiated in 2003, the primary objective of this program is to develop regional geologic framework information for the management of coastal and marine resources. Accurate data and maps of seafloor geology are important first steps toward protecting fish habitat, delineating marine resources, and assessing environmental changes due to natural or human impacts. The project is focused on the inshore waters of coastal Massachusetts, primarily in water depths of 2-30 meters. Data collected for the mapping cooperative have been released in a series of USGS Open-File Reports (&lt;http://woodshole.er.usgs.gov/project-pages/coastal_mass/&gt;). The data collected in this study area located around the western extent of the Elizabeth Islands includes high resolution bathymetry, acoustic-backscatter intensity, seismic-reflection, and navigation data. These data were collected during a nearshore cruise in September 2010 onboard the R/V Rafael using the following equipment: an SEA Ltd SwathPlus interferometric sonar (234 kHz), Klein 3000 dual frequency sidescan sonar, an Edgetech 424 chirp subbottom profiling system, and 4 GPS antennae. More information about the cruise conducted as part of the project: Geologic Mapping of the Seafloor Offshore of Massachusetts can be found on the Woods Hole Coastal and Marine Science Center Field Activity webpage:

      <purpose>This GeoTIFF (Tagged Image File Format) image contains sidescan sonar data that were collected in Sept. 2010. These data are used to define the seafloor geology on the Vineyard Sounds side of the western Elizabeth Islands of Massachusetts</purpose>

    <logic>All sidescan data were collected during USGS-WHCMSC cruise 2010-003-FA using a Klein 3000 dual frequency sidescan-sonar towfish and a CSI LGBX Pro DGPS. Quality control was conducted during processing of the data. Any spurious data or artifacts were removed or minimized.</logic>
    <complete>All available data within the mosaic area were used to create the backscatter mosaic.</complete>
    <posacc>
      <horizpa>
        <horizpar>The navigation for these data were acquired with a Communications Systems International (CSI), Inc. LGBX Pro Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS) receiver and an antenna mounted on the cabin of the R/V Rafael. All DGPS data are referenced to WGS84. The horizontal distance (both x and y)  between towed sidescan sonar fish and the mounted GPS antennae were measured on the ship and the correction was applied in the Klein SonarPro acquisition software. The differential GPS is accurate within 1 to 2 meters. The layback of the towfish adds additional uncertainty due to changes in angle and scope of the tow cable in response to sea state and vessel speed. The total horizontal uncertainty is + or - 10 meters.</horizpar>

        <srccontr>Sidescan-sonar (acoustic-backscatter) data were acquired with a Klein 3000 dual-frequency sidescan-sonar system (100 and 500 kHz), which was towed approximately 3 m astern from a port-side davit. Klein SonarPro acquisition software was used to log the data digitally at a sample rate resulting in raw pixel resolutions of approximately 0.18 and 0.14 m in the across-track and along-track directions, respectively. Horizontal offset values between the sidescan fish and DGPS antenna were provided to SonarPro, which calculated fish position dynamically during acquisition. The Klein system produced useable data over swath widths of 150-m during cruise 2010-003-FA.</srccontr>

      <procstep>
        <procdesc>Within XSonar Software (version: 2.0) a median filtering routine (Malinverno and others, 1990) was applied to the raw 100 kHz sidescan-sonar data (.xtf) to remove speckle noise during demultiplexing; the filter was 4 pixels across track by 3 pixels along track. Also the usual normalize values (value = 4095) were modified for the starboard-side, because the transducer was malfunctioning and causing darker backscatter tones. A value of 1024 was used on the starboard channel, while 4095 was the noramilize value for the port. Some additional stripeyness exists in the mosaic due to acquisition gain adjustments and troubleshooting on the starboard transducer.
The data were further processed to correct for fish altitude, slant and beam artifacts, and then merged with the navigation (Danforth, 1997). Odd and even sidescan sonar lines were mapped separately out of XSonar at 0.5 meter/pixel resolution. Sidescan areas were defined within the cruise domain such that the sonar images mapped in XSonar would be no larger than 200 Mb.</procdesc>

        <procdesc>Edits to the metadata were made to fix any errors that MP v 2.9.32 flagged. This is necessary to enable the metadata to be successfully harvested for various data catalogs. In some cases, this meant adding text "Information unavailable" or "Information unavailable from original metadata" for those required fields that were left blank. Other minor edits were probably performed (title, publisher, publication place, etc.). Fixed a link to the project page in the abstract. Added links to publications in the cross-references section. The source information was incomplete and had to be modified to meet the standard. The distribution format name was modified in an attempt to be more consistent with other metadata files of the same data format. The metadata date (but not the metadata creator) was edited to reflect the date of these changes. The metadata available from a harvester may supersede metadata bundled within a download file. Compare the metadata dates to determine which metadata file is most recent.</procdesc>

    <overview>
      <eaover>There are no attributes associated with a GeoTIFF image.  Image pixel values contain acoustic reflectivity values normalized to an 8-bit data range.  Low-backscatter is represented by dark tones (low values) and high-backscatter is represented by bright tones (high values). The background color is set to 255 and can be turned off without removing data values.</eaover>
