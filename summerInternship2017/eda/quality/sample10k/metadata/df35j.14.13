 <abstract><para>The report summarizes the results of the common murre restoration monitoring work conducted in the northern Gulf of Alaska for the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Trustee Council. Information on population numbers, nesting chronology, and productivity of murres were collected by U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) biologists at the East Amatuli Island- Light Rock and Nord Island-northwest Islet colonies in the Barren Islands during the 1993 and 1994 nesting seasons.These data are presented and statistically compared with information reported in the 1989-1993 FWS murrage damage assessment and restoration studies, and with data obtained during 1990-1992 University of Washington (UW) and 1991 Dames &amp; Moore studies. Although positive trends in population numbers were found on two FWS and three UW plots at East Amatuli Island-Light Rock over the postspill period, no trends were apparent on larger sections of habitat at this colony or at the nearby Nord Island-Northwest Islet nesting complex. Nesting chronology was similar between study sites and about one week earlier than during 1993. Productivity also did not differ between study sites. In general, reproductive success in the Barren Islands was normal to high, compared with other Gulf of Alaska murres colonies.</para>

 <methods> <methodStep> <description> <section> <title>Population Counts</title>
 <para>Three different types of counts were made at the East Amatuli Island- Light Rock and Nord Island- Northwest Islet murre colonies: censuses of entire colonies; counts of sets of multicount plots (plots used for trend analyses that are counted at least five separate times during the census period); and counts of productivity study plots. The multicount and populaltion census plot counts were made from boats using standard FWS protocols that took into account daily and seasonal attendance patterns of adults. Productivity plots were counted from land using daily and seasonal attendance patterns of adults. Productivity plots were counted from land using standard procedures. Data were compared with information from 1989-1992 FWS damage assessment and restoration studies; two Exxon- sponsored studies including one by the University of Washington (UW) in 1990-1992, and one by Dames &amp; Moore in 1991; and more recent counts made during the 1993 restoration work. One-way analysis of variance and Turkey HSD multiple pariwise comparison tests were used to check for differences among years. Counts were tested for trends with Kendall's Tau rank correlation tests.</para>
 <para>More frequent counts were made on a series of multicount plots at both colonies to collect data for statistical analyses of among-year differences and trends in population size. These special sets of plots contained about 10-15% of the murres on the cliffs at nesting complexes. We also counted about 500 birds on a series of productivity plots at both colonies every time we visited these special study sites. The productivity plot counts provided information on seasonal attendance patterns that helped define the boundaries of the census period, and they also supplied us with additional sets of data for population trend analyses.</para>
 <para>To count murres at East Amatuli Island- Light Rock, we divided the colony into 64 population census plots (BCP1-64) and 8 multicount plots (BMP1-8). When setting up the new plots, we combined several UW plots into larger units to make boundaries easier to find. Care was taken to ensure that the new plots still allowed comparisons of counts among years. The multicount plots were scattered throughout the colony to sample both central and peripheral areas in general proportion to the number of birds using these habitats. Initially, all previously established plots were located by using photographs in the Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge (AMNWR) archives and maps and photographs on loan from UW staff. After 29 July, we used a new set of photographs taken for the AMNWR files to find the plot boundaries.</para>
 <para>To census birds at Nord Island-Northwest Islet, we used 26 population census plots (BCP1-10 and 12-27) and 11 multicount plots (BMP1-11) established during previous FWS postspill studies to count birds and track population size. We also set up 2 new census plots (BCP11 and 28) in areas that contained small numbers of murres not reported before. Historical plots were located from photographs in AMNWR files. The new plots and several others established during the earlier FWS studies were photographed to update AMNWR records.</para>
 <para>The population census and multicount plots were counted from boats by teams of observers equipped with 7 x 42 binoculars and hand-held tally-meters.</para>
 <para>All counts of birds on the multicount and population census plots were made during the part of the breeding season when attendance was most stable. The census period was defined as the interval between the peak of egg-laying and the first sea-going chicks. Start and stop dates were iniitally based on our general observations of egg-laying at the closely monitored productivity plots. After attendance data from these frequently visited plots were analyzed, we used the results to refine the census interval.</para>
 <para>We used a combination of census guidelines, sun-time, and information on attendance patterns from previous Barren Islands studies to determine the best times of day for counting plots. All counts were made during 1100-2000 hours Alaskan Daylight Time, with the exception of 8 Light Rock plots on 2 August.</para>
 <para>Population census and multicount plots were counted by 10s. Productivity plots were counted by 1's, because the plots were small and this level of precision was needed to calculate comparative chicks per adult information.</para>
 <para>In almost all cases, 2 people counted the same population census and multicount plots at the same time. During the counts, 1 person recorded both scores without revealing his or her own count to the other observer. The recorders compared the plot scores as they were being made to see if they were within 15% of each other. If they were not, and time allowed, the plots were recounted until the scores fell within this range. Certain plots were difficult to count and the 15% accuracy level was waved to ensure the censuses were completed in 1 day. The 15% level of accuracy was chosen for the multicount and population ensus plot counts instead of the more commonly used 10% level, because these plots were censused from boats, not stable observations posts on land, and beause wind and sea conditions often limited acceptable counting conditions to 4-6 hours at the colonies.</para>

 <methodStep> <description> <section> <title>Timing of Nesting Events</title>
 <para>Median hatching dates were calculated for each of the productivity plots in the data sets. Plots were treated as sample units and median dates were averaged to describe the timing of nesting events at the study sites. Differences between average study site hatching dates and between these dates and 1993 results were checked with two tailed t-tests. Productivity plot data were also used to calculate first and mean laying dates and mean hatching dates; these variables and incidental observations of first laying dates were compared with similar information in FWS and other studies.</para>

 </methodStep>
 <methodStep> <description> <section> <title>Productivity</title>
 <para>Productivity data were collected from 10 East Amatuli Island- Light Rock and eight Nord Island study plots using standard FWS protocols that included noting incubation and brooding postures of adults, and analyzed by using midpoints between pre- and post-event observations to estimate laying and hatching dates. Plots were treated as sample units and fledglings-per-egg laid was used to measure productivity. Hatching and fledging success and periodic-visit and one-day chicks-per-adult numbers were also calculated for comparison with similar information in FWS and other studies. Among-year differences in periodic-visit and one-day chicks-per-adults results, the only variables available from the 1991-1992 FWS studies, were checked with Tukey HSD multiple pairwise comparison and ANOVA tests, and 2-tailed t-tests, respectively.</para>
