                <gco:CharacterString>This dataset contains values for chemical and microbial parameters including sediment porewater concentrations of hydrogen sulfide, oxygen, Eh, and pH; total petroleum hydrocarbons; and anaerobic/aerobic soil microbial communities from four wetland locations that were oiled from the Deepwater Horizon Oil Blowout in Mississippi and Louisiana: Salt Pan Island (SP), Marsh Point (MP), Cat Island (CI), and Skiff Island (SI). In MP, temporal studies were conducted for sediment porewaters over three years (2010-2012). At each marsh, 20-cm deep soil cores were collected at locations had observable oiling. Cores were profiled at 1cm increments for sediment porewaters measured using microelectrodes and then sliced into 2-cm sections under anaerobic conditions. Each 2-cm section was analyzed for TPH and aerobic/anaerobic microbial communities. At all locations water column temperature, dissolved oxygen, and salinity was recorded. This dataset is also registered with GRIIDC as Y1.x103.000:0004.</gco:CharacterString>

            <gmd:purpose>
                <gco:CharacterString>This study intended to allow the identification of &#x2018;hotspots&#x2019; of marsh degradation and the extent of recovery (if any) post Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill. The overall goal of the proposed research was to quantify and map the ecological impact of the oil spill on the photosynthetic activity, physiological status, and primarily productivity of the coastal salt marshes to facilitate the prioritization of future restoration actions. The specific questions to be answered through study were: What is the degree of damage and extent of recovery in the spill impacted marsh habitats? And Is the damage due to sedimentary biogeochemical processes resulting from the degradation of the oil and increased microbial production of reduced chemical species such as sulfide?</gco:CharacterString>

Cores at least 15 cm in depth, preferably with overlying water, were collected manually or by using a hand coring device Sediment cores were taken to a 10-15 cm depth using core liners 9 cm in diameter and ~30-35 cm in length. Cores were then transported to a field laboratory for electrode analysis. Electrode profiles were collected using the Unisense microelectrode profiling system, Sensor Trace Pro software. The cores were then refrigerated and transported back to Mississippi State University to be sliced under anaerobic conditions to preserve the biological community. The refrigerated core was sliced into five 2 cm subsections inside a nitrogen-filled glove bag. The 2 cm sub sections were placed inside whirl bags and refrigerated until analysis was completed for Biolog. Only the top 6 cm of samples was analyzed, so for each core there were three samples: 0-2 cm, 2-4 cm and 4-6 cm depth, zero being the surface. Samples were prepared following traditional Biolog procedures where the sample was diluted 1:1,000 and pipetted into 96 well plates. Plates were incubated for 96 hours with measurements taken in 24 hour increments. Plates were read using a Fisher Scientific Original Multiskan MCC and data generated was statistically analyzed. To determine if sites were contaminated, total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) were measured. Samples were prepared using a method for non-polar hydrocarbon extraction modified from EPA Method 1664 (1995), in which, non-polar hydrocarbons are extracted from five to ten grams of sediment. Sediments were weighed into 40 mL vials and 20 mL of methylene chloride was added. Samples were vortex mixed for one minute then placed in a sonicator for ten minutes. Samples were then poured through 20 g of anhydrous sodium sulfate and filtered into a 50 mL pre-weighed beaker. The filter and sodium sulfate was then rinsed with 20 mL of methylene chloride to wash out any sample still in the filter. Beakers were placed in a fume hood until the methylene chloride evaporated and beakers were weighed again in order to calculate residual oil in the beaker. After finding the difference in the pre- and post- weight of the beaker TPH was calculated by dividing the residual by the weight of sediment it was extracted from. In order to get a more precise measure of TPHs present in samples, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis was also done. Samples were extracted in the same way as for TPH however, after evaporation was complete, the residue left in the beaker was dissolved with 4 mL of methylene chloride. The ~1000- 2000 ppm concentrated sample was then transferred into a 4 mL vial to be kept until GC-MS analysis. For GC-MS analysis, 1&#x3BC;L of sample was run through a 30 meter Perkin- Elmer Elite 225 column. The column is a crossbond of 50% yanopropylmethyl and50% phenylmethyl polysiloxane with a 0.32 mm ID. The injector temperature was 300&#xB0;C. The GC began at 100&#xB0;C and temperature increased at 5&#xB0;C per minute until reaching 250&#xB0;C. Temperature was maintained at 250&#xB0;C for twenty minutes. After analyzing 1&#x3BC;L of concentrated sample, the results were run through a library of compounds to identify compounds indicative of hydrocarbon contamination. Preliminary study method deviations - The focus of the preliminary study was to determine how sediment biogeochemistry differs at contaminated and non-contaminated sites at Marsh Point in Ocean Springs, Mississippi. In October and November of 2010, six cores were taken at a contaminated site and six cores were taken at a non-contaminated site, three cores in marsh grass and three cores in sediment. Cores were capped, sealed, and transported back to the field lab where they were analyzed for pore water oxygen (O2) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) using microelectrodes. Once cores were transported to the field laboratory, cores were analyzed for pore water hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and oxygen (O2) using a microelectrode profiling system. One profiled core from each site was refrigerated and other cores were frozen and transported back to the laboratory at Mississippi State University for further analysis. In order to complete Biolog analysis the refrigerated 2 cm sub sections were used. To analyze October 2010 samples, one ECO Microplate was used for each 2 cm subsection. Anaerobic Biolog analysis was not conducted in October 2010, however, both aerobic and anaerobic Biolog analysis was completed for November 2010. One ECO MicroPlate was used to measure the aerobic community and two AN Microplates were used to measure the anaerobic community. Only one ECO plate was used because ECO plates have replication in the wells, however, two AN plates were used because anaerobic plates do not have replication in the wells. Spatial study method deviations - Cores were collected at four locations: Salt Pan Island, Marsh Point, and Cat Island, Mississippi and Skiff Island, Louisiana (Figure 2.1). At each location three sites were chosen and three cores were taken at each of the three sites; a total of nine cores were taken per location. Cores were only taken in marsh grasses. Travel time to Marsh Point from GCRL was less than 30 minutes so electrode profiling was done at the GCRL. Traveling time back to a field laboratory to do electrode analysis was too long to prevent the core from either getting disturbed or from altering its geochemical state for Saltpan Island, Cat Island, and Skiff Island. Therefore, electrode analysis equipment was set up on the beach at these locations for profiling in the field. Electrode data was collected using H2S, O2, Eh, and pH microelectrodes. Electrode analysis was done on only one core from each site totaling to three cores per location. The remaining two cores collected at each site were sliced in the field and frozen for hydrocarbon analysis. Biolog analysis was conducted using the refrigerated 2 cm subsections of sliced cores. For each 2 cm depth, two ECO plates were used and two AN plates were used. One ECO plate was incubated in aerobic conditions and the remaining ECO plate was incubated in anaerobic conditions in order to compare color development for the same carbon sources with replication. The two AN plates were incubated in anaerobic conditions in order to better measure the anaerobic community based on anaerobic media. |YSI 85 Handheld Fisher Scientific Original Multiskan MCC Gas chromatography-mass spectrometer Microelectrodes |||</gco:CharacterString>
