 <abstract><para>The Vermont Breeding Bird Atlas (VBBA) is the most comprehensive bird survey in the state, and occurs only once every 25 years. The first Atlas in Vermont was published in 1985, and in 2002, we embarked on the second. From 2003 to 2007. The goal of the first Atlas was to document the spatial distribution of each bird species at a broad geographical scale. Our primary goal for the second generation Atlas was to survey the same lands in Vermont that were surveyed 25 years ago in order to detect changes in the distribution of species. Other goals of the second Atlas included:

- identify rare species and important breeding areas for birds
- provide data for species and groups of species not adequately surveyed by other existing surveys
- enhance public awareness of birds through presentations, workshops and field trips
- expand the existing network and skill level of citizen scientists in Vermont by encouraging participation in this project
- combine data from atlases carried out in the same region to assess distributional changes at a broader scale

The Vermont Breeding Bird Atlas data package includes all records from the first and second atlases.

 <para>Sampling Design</para>
 <para>Each participant in the project, referred to as an observer or ‘atlaser’, is assigned one or more blocks (grid cells) in which to conduct extensive area searches. They record any breeding evidence observed for each bird species; this evidence is categorized as “confirmed”, “probable” or “possible”. The results can be mapped and will then provide comprehensive information about the distribution of breeding birds in the region covered. For more information on BBAs see the North American Ornithological Atlas Committee (NORAC) website.</para>
 <para>Sampling and Block Coverage</para>
 <para>Vermont was divided into “priority blocks” – sections of land throughout the state that were surveyed in the first Atlas or were selected for this Atlas. Each block consisted of 1/6 of a USGS 7.5 minute topographic quad. One priority block from each quad and some secondary priority blocks from many quads were randomly chosen and surveyed. A total of 179 blocks were selected to be surveyed in the first Atlas-these were referred to as “Priority 1 blocks”. The secondary blocks chosen-referred to as “Priority 2 blocks”-were surveyed in the second Atlas along with Priority 1 blocks, in order to double the land area covered.</para>
 <para>In order to choose Priority 2 blocks, we randomly selected a block from the five non-priority blocks in each of the 179 quadrangles used in the first Atlas. If the the randomly selected block had less than 69 species recorded in the first Atlas and a different non-priority block had at least 69 species recorded, we used the latter block. If there was more than one non-priority block with at least 69 species in the first Atlas, we used the block with the greatest number of species. In the first Atlas, some quadrangles did not fall entriely within Vermont and were not included in the block selection process. In the second Atlas, blocks were added in these borderline areas as Priority 2 blocks. A total of 186 Priority 2 blocks were added in the second Atlas. The total number of Priority 1 and 2 blocks was 365. The remaining 872 non-priority block were not selected to be surveyed, but were surveyed opportunistically.</para>
 <para>Observer Training</para>
 <para>Inexperienced birders were usually paired with more experienced birders. Many counties held workshops to discuss objectives, protocols, tips and to answer questions. Support materials were provided to atlasers and reminders and updates via a Vermont Breeding Bird Atlas listserv provided valuable information as well as a way to maintain momentum, share interim results, and create a sense of community around the Atlas.</para>
 <para>Field Work</para>
 <para>Participants were assigned one or more blocks to survey, the number assigned depending on how much time they could commit during the five-year survey period and their birding skill level. Blocks were surveyed for anywhere from 1 to 5 years, depending on the amount of effort expended on a block in a give year. In order to avoid falsely recording a migrant as a potenital breeder, we established “safe dates” for each species. Safe dates were established using data from the first Vermont Atlas, Records of Vermont Birds, and reasearch and monitoring projects within the state. When Vermont data or expertise was not available for a species, data from neighboring states were used to estimate appropriate dates for Vermont. Most blocks were surveyed between 15 May – 1 August.</para>
 <para>The protocol for surveying a block followed that of other atlases, and in accordance with the general principles outlined in the North American Atlas Committee (NORAC) guidelines.The goal was to survey the block until at least 75% of the species likely to occur in the block were found, and evidence of nesting of at least 50% of these species was confirmed. Atlasers recorded all bird species detected within safe dates and any breeding evidence observed for each bird species. The amount of time needed to survey a block depended on topography, habitat complexity and diversity, accessibility of habitats, and, to some extent, skill level of the volunteer. On average, complete coverage of a block required ~ 50 hours of field work.</para>
 <para>Incidental observations made when people were not actively atlassing were also recorded, but without associated effort hours.</para>
