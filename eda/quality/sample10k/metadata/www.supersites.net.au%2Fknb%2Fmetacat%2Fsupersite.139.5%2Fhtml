        <abstract>
            <para>Ants are a focal faunal taxon for the Australian SuperSite Network and the Australian Transect Network (ATN). Ants are Australia’s dominant faunal group in terms of biomass and energy flow. They occupy all trophic levels, act as ecosystem engineers, feature in many mutualistic interactions with plants, and are a key food resource for many vertebrates.  Ants are also Australia’s best studied insect group in terms of biogeography and community dynamics. They are the most widely used invertebrate bio-indicators in environmental assessment and monitoring.   Ants are readily sampled for monitoring purposes using pitfall traps. Pitfall traps are especially effective in open habitats, where the great majority of ant species are trappable. Pitfall traps capture less of the fauna in tropical rainforests (which support a high diversity of specialist arboreal taxa), but have still proven effective for environmental assessment and monitoring in these habitats. Pitfall traps have been used to sample ants at thousands of sites from throughout Australia over the past 30 years."</para>

                        <para>The site location is located a short distance outside of the TERN core 1ha area. 30m by 40m grid with each of the 20 pits set at 10m spacing was established. If the container position on the grid was occupied by a rock or tree, the container and marker was placed adjacent to it. The extent of the grid was permanently marked with star droppers at each corner.</para>
                        <para>Each pit trap was permanently marked with a metal pin containing a labelled (Ant Trap 1 - Ant Trap 20) aluminium tag and a piece of flagging tape. Lengths of 40mm PVC pipe were set in each pit hole to make them permanent. The sampling jar, a 4cm diameter plastic medical specimen container, slots into this PVC tube. It is set so that the lip of the container is completely flush with the soil surface.</para>
                        <para>Approximately 1cm of ethylene glycol was placed in the bottom of each container and the soil smoothed around the lip of the container. The containers were left in the field for 3 days and then collected.</para>
                        <para>At the end of sampling period the sample jar was removed and sealed. It was replaced with an empty, lidded specimen container to avoid the PVC pipe being buried. The pits were then covered in sand to protect the jar from exposure.</para>
                        <para>Clods of dirt and debris were removed from samples using forceps and the sample was run through a nylex mesh filter to clean it. Ants and other bycatch were returned to the container with fresh ethylene glycol. The containers were stored in the dark until postage to prevent light damaging the samples.</para>
                        <para>The samples were labelled with a pencil with the following information:</para>
                        <para>Calperum Mallee Supersite</para>
                        <para>Ant Trap ‘X’ (1-20)</para>
                        <para>20150512 – 20150515</para>
                        <para>Collector: Rhiannon Oates</para>
                        <para>The ants were then sent by post to Alan Andersen (CSIRO Darwin, 564 Vanderlin Drive, Berrimah, NT 0828), for taxonomic identification and storage.</para>
