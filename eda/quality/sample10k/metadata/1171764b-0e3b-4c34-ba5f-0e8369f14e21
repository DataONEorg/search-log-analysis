      <abstract>The USGS compiles online access to water-resources data collected at 
			approximately 1.5 million sites in all 50 States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, 
			the Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa and the Commonwealth of the Northern 
			Mariana Islands.
			</abstract>
      <purpose>To provide access to the investigations, occurrence, quantity, quality, 
			distribution, and movement of surface and underground waters and disseminates the 
			data to the public, State and local governments, public and private utilities, and other 
			Federal agencies involved with managing our water resources.

USGS Water-Quality Data for the Nation is a 
comprehensive and distributed application that 
supports the acquisition, processing, and long-term 
storage of water data. Water Data for the Nation 
serves as the publicly available portal to a 
geographically seamless set of much of the 
water data maintained within NWIS. 
								
The USGS collects and analyzes chemical, physical, 
and biological properties of water, sediment and tissue 
samples from across the Nation. The Water Data for 
the Nation  discrete sample data base is a compilation 
of over 4.4 million historical water quality analyses in 
the USGS district data bases through September 2005. 
The discrete sample data is a large and complex set 
of data that has been collected by a variety of projects 
ranging from national programs to studies in small 
watersheds. Users should review the help notes and 
particularly the data retrieval precautions before 
beginning any retrieval or analysis of data from this 
data set. Additions of more current data, modifications 
to ancillary information, and enhanced retrieval options 
to help users find and appropriately use the data they 
need are planned for a future release of Water Data 
for the Nation. 
								
At selected surface-water and groundwater sites, the 
USGS maintains instruments that continuously record 
physical and chemical characteristics of the water 
including pH, specific conductance, temperature, 
dissolved oxygen, and percent dissolved-oxygen 
saturation. Supporting data such as air temperature 
and barometric pressure are also available at some 
sites. At sites where this information is transmitted 
automatically, data are available from the  current 
data system. Once a complete day of readings are 
received from a site,  daily summary data are 
generated and made available online. 
								
Each USGS Science Center serves the water quality data 
of the stations it services. A list of these pages may be 
seen at http://water.usgs.gov/realtime.html  Every District 
realtime page (some have several pages) contains a list of 
the stations for which realtime data are available and a link 
to the data for each station.
 								
Every day, an automatic process retrieves the water quality
pages from each District and parses them to find the stations
served and the URL for each station's data. The station numbers
on this list are matched against a master list of USGS stations
to find the station name and the latitude/longitude of each
realtime station. This information is used to prepare an updated
point coverage.

&#8226;Medium Codes, Descriptions, and Definitions (medium_cd) 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The 3-character alpha code that identifies the material type and quality-assurance type of the sample. The first character of the code is the "super" medium, which describes the primary matrix of the sample. The second character is the sub-medium, which characterizes the sample type as a unique entity within the "super" medium category. The third character is used to designate whether a sample is an environmental or QC sample. A blank in position three denotes an environmental sample; a "Q" in position three denotes a QC sample.

WS	Surface water	Water on the surface of the Earth stored or transported in rivers, streams, estuaries, lakes, ponds, swamps, glaciers, or other aquatic areas. It also may refer to water in urban drains and storm-sewer systems.	9
WG	Groundwater	Water below the surface of the Earth contained in the saturated zone. It does not include soil moisture or interstitial water.	6
WW	Wet deposition	Water reaching the Earth's surface through precipitation as rain, snow, sleet, hail, or condensation of fog and dew. The water may contain undissolved particulate and gaseous materials acquired from the atmosphere during precipitation.	7
WI	Interstitial water	Water occuring in the small openings, spaces, pores, and voids between particles of unconsolidated materials. Includes water found in the interstices of shallow sediments of a lake, wetland, reservoir, or stream, and in the vadose zone between the root zone and the water table. The water is held in place by entrapment, ionic attraction, and capillary or adhesive forces, rather than from pressure components of saturation.	F
WA	Air moisture	Water present in air in a gaseous form. Air moisture plays a significant role in weather when it changes from one state to another. These changes include condensation (cloud, fog, dew, and frost) and precipitation (rainfall and snowfall).	
WM	Soil moisture	Water occupying voids between loose soil particles within the aerated root zone. The water is held in place by surface tension, capillary and hydroscopic forces in opposition to the pull of gravitational forces.	K
WL	Leachate	A solution obtained by passing a liquid (usually aqueous) through an unconsolidated solid medium, thereby dissolving materials (from the solid medium) which become a part of the solution. It also contains those precipitates that are the result of the solution process and subsequent chemical or biological reactions.	2
WF	Landfill effluent	A liquid material (usually water) that is drained or pumped from a landfill. It usually is a liquid that has percolated through solid landfill material to become a transport medium for materials dissolved from the landfill.	4
WU	Elutriation	A process by which a mixture of an unconsolidated solid medium (usually soil) and a liquid medium (usually water) has been agitated for a given period of time to dissolve materials from the solid. The solid/liquid mixture is finally separated and the resulting solution is analyzed for materials dissolved during the elutriation process.	5
WE	Effluent	Treated or untreated wastewater after use at a facility or wastewater treatment plant, or from combined sources, such as combined-sewer overflows or tile drainage systems.	%
WT	Treated water supply	Water after being processed for some particular use(s)	$
WB	Untreated water supply	Untreated water supply from a blend of surface and ground waters or from unknown sources.	
WH	Hyporheic zone	 Near-stream subsurface environment where mixing occurs between subsurface water and surface water. Water flows not only in the open stream channel, but also through the interstices of stream-channel and bank sediments, thus creating a mixing zone with subsurface water. There is not a precise separation between groundwater and surface water, thus the hyporheic zone is not precisely defined.	~
WC	Canopy water	  Water dripping off tree-leaf canopies or running down the trunks of trees.	\
WP	Plant Water	Water that is extracted from plant tissue and subsequently analyzed for its chemical properties. This includes both intra- and extracellular water in the plant tissue.	
SS	Suspended sediment	Sediment carried in suspension by the turbulent components of the fluid or by the Brownian movement (a law of physics).	1
SB	Bottom material	A mixture of mineral and organic matter that compose the top bed deposits (usually the first few inches) underlying a body of water.	H
ST	Solids	" Unconsolidated materials that may be soils, cores, borehole cuttings, sediments, matter suspended in water or wastewater, street sweepings, other particulate matter, or the total array of materials that are collected as part of a ""clean sweep"""	B
SC	Core material	Consolidated or unconsolidated material removed from a pipe or casing during a drilling (coring) operation.	E
SU	Borehole cuttings	Unconsolidated material removed from a pipe or casing during a drilling (coring) operation	
SO	Soil	A wet or dry substance composed of unconsolidated fine grain rock fragments (minerals) and organic material that has been modified sufficiently by physical, chemical, or biological processes to support terrestrial plant growth.	G
SL	Sludge	An unconsolidated material, from an anthropogenic source, covering the ground or the bed of a water body, usually originating as a result of processes such as domestic or industrial waste treatment.	J
SD	Dry deposition	Solid, aerosol or gaseous materials deposited from the atmosphere during dry weather periods.	3
BA	Animal tissue	Any type of tissue that comprises either whole or parts of insects, fish, or other organisms living in an aquatic environment, or animals that may or may not have been collected from a water body.	C
BP	Plant tissue	Any type of non-animal tissue that comprises either whole or parts of plants, aquatic or non-aquatic.	D
BH	Phytoplankton (quantitative)	Phytoplanktonic species composition and enumeration (quantitative).	L
BY	Phytoplankton (qualitative)	Phytoplanktonic species composition (qualitative).	M
BE	Periphyton (qualitative)	Periphyton species composition (qualitative).	N
BI	Benthic invertebrates (quan)	Benthic invertebrates species composition and enumeration (quantitative).	O
BD	Periphyton (quantitative)	Periphyton species composition and enumeration (quantitative).	P
AA	Air	Sample of atmospheric gases.	*
AS	Soil gas	Gases occurring in the small openings, spaces, and voids between articles of unconsolidated materials in that portion of the vadose water zone between the root zone and the water table.	&amp; amp;
OA	Artificial	Any substance that is not part of an aquatic environment and cannot be described by the Sample Medium Codes	A
ON	Not determined	Not determined	0
OB	Bulk deposition	A mixture of undesignated proportions of wet and dry deposition sampled by a continuously open container.	8

&#8226;Parameter Codes
--------------------------
Parameter codes are 5-digit codes used to identify the constituent measured and the units of measure. Some parameter code definitions include information about the methods used to measure the constituent, but this level of information is not currently consistent in the naming system. There are two types of parameter codes:

&#8226;Fixed-value codes - The result value is a numeric code that represents a textual meaning. [ See: http://help.waterdata.usgs.gov/code/fixed_parms_query?fmt=html ] 

&#8226; Numeric codes
-----------------------
 The result is a numeric value for chemical, physical, and biological data.
The following table shows an example of several parameter codes and definitions. This table also illustrates how several parameter codes may exist for one type of measurement.
Parameter Code   Parameter Definition  
00910 Calcium, water, unfiltered, milligrams per liter as calcium carbonate 
00915 Calcium, water, filtered, milligrams per liter 
00916 Calcium, water, unfiltered, recoverable, milligrams per liter 
91051 Calcium, water, filtered, micrograms per liter
