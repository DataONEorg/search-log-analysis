    <abstract>
      <para>
  This database is from regular monitoring of water level and surface
  ice cover at Frank B. Cross Reservoir, a small freshwater impoundment
  in northeastern Kansas (USA). Cross Reservoir, located at the
  University of Kansas Field Station near Lawrence (KS), has a 3-ha
  surface area and a maximum depth of 12 m. Measurements of water
  elevation and estimates of ice cover were made at semi-monthly
  intervals (i.e., roughly every two weeks). The first data were taken
  in December 1993, shortly after the reservoir was constructed and
  first filled to capacity. Water levels were measured relative to a
  permanent water control structure. Ice cover observations were visual
  estimates of the percent (%) surface of the reservoir covered with
  ice. Water level measurements and ice cover estimates are made at the
  same time. This database is updated periodically and maintenance is
  ongoing.

      <geographicCoverage>
        <geographicDescription>Frank B. Cross Reservoir is located on University of Kansas Field Station property north-northeast of Lawrence, Kansas (the straight line distance from the Lawrence City Hall at Sixth and Massachusetts Streets, on the south bank of the Kansas River, to Cross Reservoir is approximately 6 miles [10 kilometers]). Cross Reservoir lies in Leavenworth County (Section 34, Range 20 E, Township 11S); however, the majority of its 50-ha watershed is in Jefferson County.</geographicDescription>

          <para>
  Measurements were made at regular two-week intervals as close to the
  first and the fifteenth of each month as possible. Additional
  measurements may have been taken on an opportunistic basis to document
  episodic phenomena (e.g., following a heavy rain). Occasionally there
  is a missing sampling event such that the interval between sampling is
  approximately one month. Data are recorded on standard data forms and
  archived at the University of Kansas Field Station headquarters, and
  at the Kansas Biological Survey (Higuchi Hall, Lawrence, KS). In
  addition to water level and ice cover, field sheets may contain
  miscellaneous observations and notes.
</para>
          <para>
  Water elevation: Water level (elevation) is recorded relative to the
  top of a concrete water control structure (which is a 61 cm [24 inch]
  diameter vertical tube encased in concrete near the dam). Water levels
  below the top of the concrete standpipe are recorded as a negative
  value, and water levels above the top of the concrete standpipe are
  recorded as a positive value. Our method called for a measurement to
  the nearest inch relative to the top of the overflow tube. However,
  frequently the data were recorded to the nearest 0.5 inch,
  particularly for elevations near “zero”. If water is above the top of
  the tube the measurement is recorded as a positive number, or if water
  is below the tube it is recorded as a negative number. A special case
  occurs when the water level is recorded as “zero.” For those cases a
  notation is made (as “yes” or “no” on the data sheet) as to whether
  water is running (often referred to as “trickling”) into the
  standpipe.
</para>
          <para>
  Ice cover: Ice cover on the reservoir is visually estimated as the
  percent (%) of the reservoir surface that is covered by ice on the
  observation date. Note that these are simply visual estimates made by
  the observer; no quantitative check has been run to determine the
  accuracy of the observation. No estimate is made of the thickness of
  the ice.
</para>
          <para>
  Data from field sheets were entered into an Excel spreadsheet and
  error-checked. The Excel spreadsheet was then converted to a CSV text
  file.
