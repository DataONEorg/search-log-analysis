            <para>Destructive sampling of 47 Eucalyptus obliqua trees was         carried out to determine a range of biomass measures that can be         used to inform allometric equations. Method Step Description The         same sequence of activities was followed for each tree harvested         in this study: a)  Selection of trees: the trees were selected         by personnel from State Forests of NSW and Forestry Tasmania to         reflect as closely as possible the range and quality of trees         that are harvested during a commercial harvesting operation in         that area. b)  Measurement of tree DBH. c)  Felling of the tree         using a chainsaw. d)  Measurement of the length of the tree and         stump height. e)  Transport of the logs and crown from the         forest to the log dump by an excavator.  f)  Weight of the         crown: the crown was lifted by the excavator and placed on a         platform placed on top of the weight bars to allow measurement         of material shorter than the span between the weigh bars.  g)         Weight of full-length log (still with the bark on): the logs         were placed on top of hardwood beams placed on the weigh bars to         optimise load sharing. Some logs exceeded the capacity of the         weigh bars; in those cases, they were either split or shortened         and each component measured separately.  h)  Debarking of the         log (by the excavator). i)  Weight of the main log (debarked),         as in “g”. j)  Sampling of the log: disks were cut at both ends         of the log for laboratory analyses, after the outermost sections         were discarded. The disks were put in sealed plastic bags. k)         Grading and cutting of the log into log products. The log         product categories used were: sawlog, veneer logs and pulp. l)         Measurement of length and diameters at both ends of each log         product. m)  Weight of each log product as in “g”.  n)  Sampling         of crown: random samples were cut with the chainsaw and placed         in sealed plastic bags. A visual assessment was undertaken to         estimate any losses (crown material and bark) that may have         occurred during to transport of each crown and log from the         forest to the log dump.</para>

                    <para>The selection of the trees and measurement of their DBHs was carried out on the week before the study. The study involved a harvesting crew, personnel from State Forests of NSW and Forestry Tasmania. The trees were felled using a chainsaw and removed from the forest with an excavator. In total 44 trees were felled specifically for the harvesting study. A Nikon camera was used to photograph the study and a digital Sharp hand-held video camera was used to film the activities.</para>
