        <descript>
            <abstract>Water depth is an important feature of aquatic systems. On the Upper Mississippi River System (UMRS), water depth data are important for describing the physical template of the system and monitoring changes in the template caused by sedimentation. Although limited point or transect sampling of water depth can provide valuable information on habitat character in the UMRS as a whole, the generation of bathymetric surfaces are critical for conducting spatial inventories of the aquatic habitat. The maps are also useful for detecting bed elevation changes in a spatial manner as opposed to the more common method of measuring changes along transects. The Upper Midwest Environmental Sciences Center (UMESC) has been collecting bathymetric data within the UMRS since 1989 in conjunction with the Long Term Resource Monitoring Program (LTRMP).</abstract>
            <purpose>The Upper Midwest Environmental Sciences Center administers the Long Term Resource Monitoring Program (LTRMP), authorized under the Water Resources Development Act of 1986 (Public Law 99-662). The mission of the LTRMP is to provide decision-makers with information to maintain the Upper Mississippi River System (UMRS) as a viable large river ecosystem given its multiple-use character. The long-term goals of the Program are to understand the system, determine resource trends and impacts, develop management alternatives, manage information, and develop useful products. The creation and distribution of bathymetric data for the UMRS aids the Center in meeting these goals.</purpose>
            <supplinf>Bathymetric data are served as ArcInfo format compressed Grid coverages and as shape files. The data are stored in Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) projection zone 15  North American Datum 1983 (NAD83) coordinates. Project status information along with detailed information on how the bathymetric data are collected and processed are available through the UMESC Web site (www.umesc.usgs.gov/aquatic/bathymetry.html). Graphics of the data are also.</supplinf>
