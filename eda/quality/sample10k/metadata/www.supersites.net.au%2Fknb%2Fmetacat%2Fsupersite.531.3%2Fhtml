        <abstract>
            <para>A cosmic ray soil moisture sensor was installed at the Tumbarumba Wet Eucalypt Supersite on 03 Apr 2011 by the Australian Cosmic Ray Soil Moisture Monitoring Network (CosmOz; http://www.ermt.csiro.au/html/cosmoz.html). CosmOz represents just one of a growing number of networks around the World. Other networks are found in USA, Germany, and the UK with other projects adopting the technology in South America, Africa and Europe.   These sensors use cosmic rays originating from outer space to measure average soil moisture over an area of about 40 hectares to a depth up to 90 cm. The system measures fast neutrons that are produced from interactions of cosmic rays with the atmosphere and top few meters of soil. The intensity of these neutrons are moderated largely by water molecules in the soil. The number of neutrons counted over a period of time is inversely proportional to the amount of water in the soil. To estimate volumetric water content, each system is calibrated against soil samples that are collected from dry and wet moisture regimes using a standard protocol.  Data is collected every 60 min and uploaded to data portal infrastructure which is maintained by the University of Arizona. This infrastructure and associated web interface were established as part of the US based Cosmic-ray Soil Moisture Observation System (COSMOS, http://cosmos.hwr.arizona.edu/). Collaboration between Australian and US researchers has facilitated a data hosting agreement which has now resulted in a growing international data portal for delivering and processing data from cosmic-ray probes.  Tumbarumba Supersite land cover: Wet sclerophyll eucalyptus forest, Land use: native/plantation forestry, Soil type: Acidic, eutrophic red dermosol, 3 - 4 m deep  Tumbarumba data can be downloaded from http://cosmos.hwr.arizona.edu/Probes/StationDat/077/index.php</para>

                        <para>Soil moisture calibration data for Tumbarumba is available at http://cosmos.hwr.arizona.edu/Probes/StationDat/077/calib.php and a copy of this data is also present as a dataset in the Australian Supersite Network database.  Raw data is uploaded to COSMOS at the University of Arizona and is made available in three different levels.  - Level 1 data is raw data from the probes.  - Level 2 data is quality controlled and corrected for local effects.  - Level 3 data estimates soil moisture from cleaned, corrected data.  Further details available at http://cosmos.hwr.arizona.edu/Docs/data.txt</para>

                <samplingDescription>
                    <para>Level 1 Data contains raw counts of fast and thermal neutrons  as well as probe diagnostics for quality control purposes.  Neutrons  are counted over a time period (usually one hour) and count levels are  reported at the end of each period.  Level 2 Data takes raw, Level 1 data and converts it to a format suitable for soil moisture computation.  The data is quality controlled, so that records:  (1) with fast neutron counts more than 20% different to previous counts, (2) with fast neutron counts less than 40% of the maximum count rate, (3) with fast neutron counts greater than the maximum count rate, (4) with probe voltages less than 10 V, are flagged and removed from future analyses. The numbers in brackets are flag values.  Actual flag values for data can be found by clicking on 'Level 1 Data' for any probe, and changing '.txt' in the URL to '.fla'.  Alternately, flags are listed in the complete station database at http://cosmos.hwr.arizona.edu/Util/bystations.php Fast counts are then converted to standard counts to remove local effects. For standard counts we use the reference probe, located at San Pedro, Arizona  (http://cosmos.hwr.arizona.edu/Probes/StationDat/002/index.php).  Level 3 Data takes quality controlled, corrected Level 2 data and converts  it directly to a soil moisture measurement.</para>
