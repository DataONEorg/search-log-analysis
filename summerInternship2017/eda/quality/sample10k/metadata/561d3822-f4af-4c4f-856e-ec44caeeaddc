            <abstract>LiDAR data is remotely sensed high-resolution elevation data collected by an airborne collection platform.  Using a combination of laser rangefinding, GPS positioning and inertial measurement technologies; LiDAR instruments are able to make highly detailed Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) of the earth's terrain, man-made structures and vegetation.</abstract>
            <purpose>LiDAR data is used for 3D visualization, elevation based analysis and for feature extraction.</purpose>
            <supplinf>Reflective surface data represents the DEM created by laser energy reflected from the first surface encountered by the laser pulse. Some energy may continue beyond this initial surface to be reflected by a subsequent surface as represented by the Last Return data. Intensity information is captured from the Reflective Surface pulse and indicates the relative energy returned to the sensor as compared to the energy transmitted.  Points are classified as on ground surface or not on ground surface to support creation of a bare earth model from the data.</supplinf>

                <procdesc>LiDAR Processing: The collected elevation data meets the SOW's requirements for 2-foot contours. The flight altitude and speed was optimized to acquire the specified point resolution and accuracy. The highest resolution, and absolute referenced elevation data was produced. Density of ground mass points is appropriate for meeting the stated accuracies. Nominal Pulse Spacing of the LiDAR System was planned to 1.4 meters; multiple discrete returns-3 per pulse. LiDAR data was acquired from Dec. 2009 to Fall of 2011. LiDAR acquisition and processing was performed using modified USGS and FEMA guidelines as base specifications. Modifications were made to the base specifications to suit specific project needs</procdesc>

                <procdesc>LiDAR Processing: The LiDAR data is checked for quality and completeness during, and immediately following each mission. Upon verification, the laser range data is processed and output in Optech's DashMap using the SBET generated from processing the ABGPS/IMU data with ground ABGPS base stations in Applanix's POS MMS. On-site calibration flights are performed to validate the initial calibration values generated during calibration flights over Wilson &amp;amp; Company's LiDAR Calibration Range. The calibrated missions are then combined and adjusted to project control using the TerraSolid suite of products, which are used for most LiDAR processing and editing steps. An accuracy assessment is performed to validate the LiDAR surface prior to classification. Upon surface validation, the LiDAR point cloud is classified using a series of algorithms to find bare earth and other associated features. The processed bare earth surface is manually further refined to a final surface, free from anomalies and other non-ground objects. GeoCue is used as a process management tool to track process steps through a series of checklists and assigned tasks. The final point cloud data set was provided in LAS v1.2</procdesc>

This temporal discrepancy may cause some spatial discrepancy between the two datasets. The user should be aware that this deviation exists. The elevation products generated during this project were cross-checked as a complete data set as well as being subjected to independent QA/QC. All elevation products were generated from the unified and classified LiDAR point cloud. Independent QA performed by EC-TS Survey Section Defer, Bigelow and Giger in June and July 2012 Acceptance and ownership of W912EK-05-D-0004 TO 8, TO 18 and TO 21 has been approved by Scott Kool, Chief of Surveys, Rock Island District, US Army Corps of Engineers.</procdesc>
