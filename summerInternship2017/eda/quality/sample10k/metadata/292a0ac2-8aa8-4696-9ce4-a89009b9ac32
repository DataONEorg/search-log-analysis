      <abstract>The oceanographic time series data collected by U.S. Geological Survey scientists and collaborators are
served in an online database at http://stellwagen.er.usgs.gov/index.html. These data were collected as
part of research experiments investigating circulation and sediment transport in the coastal ocean. The
experiments (projects, research programs) are typically one month to several years long and have been
carried out since 1975. New experiments will be conducted, and the data from them will be added to the
collection. As of 2016, all but one of the experiments were conducted in waters abutting the U.S. coast;
the exception was conducted in the Adriatic Sea. Measurements acquired vary by site and experiment;
they usually include current velocity, wave statistics, water temperature, salinity, pressure, turbidity,
and light transmission from one or more depths over a time period. The measurements are concentrated
near the sea floor but may also include data from the water column.
The user interface provides an interactive map, a tabular summary of the experiments, and a separate
page for each experiment. Each experiment page has documentation and maps that provide details of what
data were collected at each site. Links to related publications with additional information about the
research are also provided. The data are stored in Network Common Data Format (netCDF) files using the
Equatorial Pacific Information Collection (EPIC) conventions defined by the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory. NetCDF is a general,
self-documenting, machine-independent, open source data format created and supported by the University
Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR). EPIC is an early set of standards designed to allow
researchers from different organizations to share oceanographic data. The files may be downloaded or
accessed online using the Open-source Project for a Network Data Access Protocol (OPeNDAP). The OPeNDAP
framework allows users to access data from anywhere on the Internet using a variety of Web services
including Thematic Realtime Environmental Distributed Data Services (THREDDS). A subset of the data
compliant with the Climate and Forecast convention (CF, currently version 1.6) is also available.</abstract>
      <purpose>To provide public access to measurements acquired by U.S. Geological Survey investigators that describe and quantify oceanographic processes and how they affect sediment transport and biologic productivity.</purpose>
      <supplinf>Datasets are organized by experiment; a tabular list the experiment names, the principal investigators, when and where the experiments were conducted is available at http://stellwagen.er.usgs.gov/experiments.html. The links take you to the individual experiment pages with more detailed explanation, data summaries and access. These pages may also be used to explain the content of the top-level THREDDS catalog links provided in the data distribution section.</supplinf>

    <posacc>
      <horizpa>
        <horizpar>Locational accuracy is dependent on the accuracy of the navigational technique from the individual data sources and may vary widely (e.g., from 0.005km usingdifferential GPS in more recent surveys to greater than 2 km based on radar, Loran, or dead reckoning in older surveys.) Users of the data should use their own criteria for assessing the accuracy of the locations.</horizpar>
      </horizpa>
      <vertacc>
        <vertaccr>Vertical accuracy is dependent on the accuracy of the individual water depth measurement at each deployment site.  Platforms supporting sensors are deployed on the seafloor, and the heights of the sensors on the platform are accurate to 5 cm, but the measurement of the depth at which the platform is deployed is nominal.  The source of the water depth may be from a ships fathometer, chart or visible estimate in shallow water.  The depth does not include a tidal correction, and has not been referenced to a datum. For measurements made before 2000 and in water deeper than 50m, the vertical accuracy is 2-10m.  In shallower environments, the accuracy approaches 5-10 cm. Users of the data should use their own criteria for assessing the vertical accuracy of the water depth.</vertaccr>
