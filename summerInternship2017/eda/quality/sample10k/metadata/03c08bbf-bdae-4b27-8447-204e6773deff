      <abstract>This data set contains the main stem of the Humboldt River as
defined by Humboldt Project personnel of the U.S. Geological
Survey Nevada District, 2001.  The data set was digitized on
screen using digital orthophoto quadrangles from 1994.
			</abstract>
      <purpose>This dataset was created as a layer of a geographic information
system (GIS) to calculate river miles on the Humboldt
River. The currentness and accuracy of the digital orthophoto
quadrangle (DOQ) source exceeded that of other available data.
			</purpose>
      <supplinf>Reviews
			
The digital data in this data set has gone through a rigorous,
multi-level, quality-control process that ensures the data set
is a fair representation of the source map.  If errors are
found in this data set, it will be appreciated if the
user would pass this information to the Metadata_Contact.
			
Two formal reviews were done.  The reviewers were asked to check
metadata and other documentation files for completeness and
accuracy.  Reviewers were asked to check the topological
consistency, tolerances, projections, and geographic extent.
			
Notes
			
Any use of trade, product, or firm names is for descriptive
purposes only and does not imply endorsement by the
U.S. Government.
			
Although this Federal Geographic Data Committee-compliant
metadata file is intended to document the data set in
nonproprietary form, as well as in ArcInfo format, this
metadata file may include some ArcInfo-specific terminology.

      <procstep>
        <procdesc>1. ERDAS Imagine 8.3.1 was used to import DOQs from USGS
DOQ format and USGS geo-tiff format into ERDAS Imagine(R)
format.  The data was digitized from DOQs in North American
Datum (NAD) 1983, Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) zone 11
projection.
			
2. The main channel, major perennial channels, significant
intermittent channels, and water bodies of the Humboldt River
were digitized on screen from the DOQs using the ArcInfo(R)
ArcEdit module. The tolerances used were: weedtolerance = .025,
grain = 0.5, nodesnap closest = 15. The RMS error is dependent
on the DOQ.
			
2a. Rye Patch Reservoir was digitized to what appears to be
the normal level of 4,135 feet (Jones and others, 2000).  This
was compared to elevation values derived from USGS 10-meter
digital elevation models (DEM) of the area.  Discrepancies
existed and the decision was made to go with the photo
interpretative results.  Since 1994 was a dry year, the
reservoir was low and the upper portion of the channel was
visible.  The river was digitized along the visible channel
and as a centerline through the reservoir as indicated by
Humboldt River Project Chief Russ Plume and agreed upon by
Glen Hess, Nevada District Surface Water Specialist.
			
2b. The boundaries of several intermittent water bodies
were digitized to show the terminus of distributary water
features and also show that along the lower system
watercourses had to be full for water to continue flowing
along its course.  If there was no indication of a channel
through water bodies along the Humboldt River course, a
centerline was digitized.
			
In the lower portion of the river, the land is relatively flat.
Comparisons were made between USGS 10-meter DEMs and the
interpretive photo work.  No serious conflicts were found.
The interpretative photo work was thought to be more accurate.
			
2c. All or a portion of major agricultural ditches
and diversions along the course of the
Humboldt River, especially in the vicinity of Lovelock, were
digitized.  At the request of Russ Plume, Project Chief, water
discharge ditches from a mine northwest of Battle Mountain were
also digitized.
			
2d. According Russ Plume, Glen Hess, and Carl Thodal, the
endpoint of the Humboldt River was determined to be at the
USGS gage at the last bridge, located near the west edge of the
1:24,000-scale Wildhorse Pass quadrangle.
			
3. Portions of tributary streams to the Humboldt River were
digitized on screen from the DOQs using the ArcInfo(R)
ArcEdit module. The tolerances used were:
weedtolerance = .025, grain = 0.5, nodesnap closest = 15.
The RMS error is dependent on the DOQ.
			
3a. The following tributary streams were digitized to 1 or
more quadrangle sheet boundaries at 1:24,000-scale: Marys River,
Starr Creek, Soldier Secret Creek, Lamoille Creek, North Fork
Humboldt River, South Fork Humboldt River (exception: this
feature was stopped at a dam), Dixie Creek, Tenmile Creek,
Susie Creek, Maggie Creek, Marys Creek, Pine Creek, Rock
Creek, Reese River, Kelly Creek, Little Humboldt River, and
Clear Creek.
			
3b. Portions of tributary streams from the main channels to
the Humboldt River were digitized to either correct alignment,
indicate confluences, or to join them to the 1:100,000-scale
Digital Line Graph (DLG) stream line work.
			
3c. On some of the tributary streams, numerous channels
existed where the stream would flow in times of flood or
normal flow.  An effort was made to digitize a representative
pattern of the drainage channels in these areas.  A primary
channel and other significant channels with indications of
recent flow were used.  Also included were areas where new
alternate flow routes exist.
			
4. The attributes MAINSTEM-CODE and MAINSTEM-DESC were added
using the ArcInfo (R) ADDITEM command.  These attributes
include a numeric code and a description of the code, which
describes the centerline as braid, main stem, etc. and whether
it is perennial or intermittent.
			
The main channel of the Humboldt River is attributed as
main stem, until the determined end of the river, where it is
then attributed as an extended channel to the Humboldt
Sink/Lake.  Below this point, the main stem channel centerline
is not attributed.  The channel below this point shows the
maximum flow extent possible for the river system.  Ditches,
braids, and distributaries associated with this channel are
attributed.
			
Determination of the status of non-main stem channels or
braids of the Humboldt River as perennial or intermittent
was a subjective process. If water or evidence of recent flow
such as pools or wetness was evident, a segment was assigned a
value of perennial.  Springs, and agricultural or mining runoff
also influenced the decision.  Since 1994 was a dry year and the
photography was taken during the summer any channel with water
was considered perennial.
			
Intermittent channels along the middle Humboldt River were
not digitized unless associated with tributary streams.
			
No effort was spent determining the perennial or intermittent
status of tributary streams.
			
5. The attribute NAME was added using the ArcInfo (R)
ADDITEM command. Names were added using USGS topographic maps
at 1:24,000-scale.
			
6. Several visual inspections were performed and corrections
were made as deemed necessary.  A check was made to determine
continuity of data.  Dangle nodes were all checked and
determined to be at the ends of lines only.  Intersection
errors were cleaned up using the ArcInfo(R) ArcEdit module.
Line topology was built using the ArcInfo(R) CLEAN command
(ESRI, 2001).
			
7. Attributes were checked visually using ArcView 3.1.
Consistency of spelling, abbreviation, and the relationship
between main stem code and number was checked.  Stream names
were checked using USGS topographic maps at 1:24,000-scale.
			
8. Attribution of the main channel of the Humboldt River was
confirmed by either Russ Plume or Glen Hess.
			
9. Line topology was built using the ArcInfo(R) CLEAN
command with the fuzzy tolerance = 0.001 and dangle = 0.01
(ESRI, 2001).

      <procstep>
        <procdesc>1. The DOQ hydrology data set was projected from UTM Zone 11
NAD 83 to UTM Zone 11 NAD 27 using the ArcInfo(R) PROJECT
command.
			
2. Using the ArcInfo(R) ArcEdit module, the DOQ hydrology
data was combined with the existing 1:100,000-scale DLG data
to form one continuous hydrology data set for the Humboldt
River basin.  The DOQ hydrology replaced existing
1:100,000-scale hydrology data in the combined data set.
			
3. Using the ArcInfo(R) RESELECT command, a new data set
with only the main stem of the Humboldt River was created:
"RESELECT MAINSTEM-CODE = 1 AND NAME = 'Humboldt River'"
			
4. Using the ArcInfo(R) ArcEdit module:
			
4a. The field LENGTH-MI was addded to the arc attribute
table using the ArcInfo(R) ADDITEM command:
"ADDITEM LENGTH-MI 8 18 F 5"
			
4b. The field LENGTH-MI was populated by converting the field
LENGTH (in meters) to miles:
"CALC LENGTH-MI = LENGTH * .00062137119"
			
4c. Using the ArcInfo(R) MAKEROUTE command, the route
HUMRIV was defined and the measures were computed using the
field LENGTH-MI: "MAKEROUTE HUMRIV 1 LENGTH-MI"
			
5. Line topology was built using the ArcInfo(R) CLEAN
command with the fuzzy tolerance = 0.001 and dangle = 0.01
(ESRI, 2001).

ROUTELINK# is the internal number which identifies the route
to which a section belongs.  This is the field HUMRIV# from
HYDRO_MAIN.RATHUMRIV.
			
ARCLINK# is the internal number which identifies the arc to
which a section belongs.  This is the field HYDRO_MAIN# from
HYDRO_MAIN.AAT.
			
F-MEAS is the from-measure of the section based on its
position within a route.  It was populated using the ArcInfo(R)
MAKEROUTE command which used field LENGTH-MI from HYDRO_MAIN.AAT
to calculate value.
			
T-MEAS is the to-measure of the section based on its
position within a route.  It was populated using the ArcInfo(R)
MAKEROUTE command which used field LENGTH-MI from HYDRO_MAIN.AAT
to calculate value.
			
F-POS is the from-position of section on arc, represented as a
percentage of the arc on which the section lies.
			
T-POS is the to-postion of section on arc, represented as a
percentage of the arc on which the section lies.
			
HUMRIV# is a program-generated feature identity number of section.
			
HUMRIV-ID is a user-assigned feature identity number of section.
