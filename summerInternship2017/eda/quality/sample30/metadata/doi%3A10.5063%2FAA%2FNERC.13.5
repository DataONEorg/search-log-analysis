 <abstract><para>The soil chemistry component of the Northeastern Ecosystem Research Cooperative (NERC) regional database was assembled from five prior NERC synthesis projects designed to investigate regional environmental trends in forested ecosystems of northeastern North America.  These individual NERC synthesis projects compiled soil chemistry data from independent studies conducted predominantly in the northeastern United States, with some data from southeastern Canada.  The combined foliar, soil, and surface water chemistry data in the full NERC regional database thus provide an opportunity to analyze environmental trends across ecosystem compartments at a regional scale.  Soil chemistry data in the database emphasizes nitrogen cycling, including nitrogen mineralization and nitrification rates, as well as total soil pools of elements.  Approximately half of the data in the soils data set was obtained from the online US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) National Cooperative Soil Characterization data set, while the remaining half was collected by individual investigators and research teams.</para>

 <methods><methodStep><description><section><title>Compilation of data from NERC synthesis projects</title>
 <para>Soil chemistry data were obtained from the following individual NERC synthesis project databases.  For each of these synthesis projects, investigators compiled soil chemistry data from existing studies conducted in northeastern North America, in order to facilitate the examination of regional environmental trends:</para>

 <methodStep><description><section><title>Analytical methods for determining soil chemistry</title>
 <para>Analytical methods used to determine soil chemistry varied among the individual studies included within each synthesis project.  Analytical methods are described in the synthesis project publications or in the publications for the original studies associated with these data.  Some details regarding methods (e.g., type or length of incubation, where applicable) are provided in the SoilChemistryData table.  Examples of typical methods include field or short-term laboratory assays for nitrification or nitrogen mineralization, or CHN analysis to determine soil nitrogen and carbon.  Detailed methods applicable to the USDA NRCS National Cooperative Soil Characterization data set are available online via the Soil Survey Laboratory Methods Manual (http://soils.usda.gov/technical/lmm/).</para>

 <methodStep><description><section><title>Data completeness</title>
 <para>The NERC regional database was compiled from individual synthesis projects representing numerous individual studies with differing objectives and timelines, and the goal of each synthesis project was to address a specific set of research questions.  Given these characteristics of the data sources, absence of data for a particular variable for a particular site or study does not necessarily indicate that such data do not exist.  Data in some cases may appear to be missing because they were not requested or needed to meet the goals of a specific synthesis project.</para>

 </methodStep>
 <methodStep><description><section><title>Data consistency and compilation details</title>
 <para>Most soil chemistry variables (e.g., element concentrations in soils) have been converted to the same measurement units as needed for consistency across synthesis project databases.  Methods for determining nitrification and nitrogen mineralization varied considerably among studies, and included both field measurements and laboratory incubations of varying duration; therefore, nitrification and nitrogen mineralization rates are provided in varying units, with the units specified as a separate variable.  After data compilation, outliers were cross-checked with original investigators, and any verified errors were rectified.  Duplicate data values between synthesis projects have been removed wherever detected.  Errors in compilation are possible; if you identify such an error, please contact the current database administrator.</para>

 <sampling><studyExtent><description><para>The temporal and spatial coverage of the soil chemistry data set is variable, and specific sampling periods or geographic regions may be over- or underrepresented.  For example, while the full temporal range of the data set is 1955-2002, more than 60% of the data were collected in the most recent 10 years.
The temporal and spatial extent of individual studies included within each of the listed synthesis projects varied by study.  More detailed information regarding these studies is included both in the individual synthesis project publications and in the publications associated with each study, which are listed by study in the SoilChemistryData table and by publication in the Publications table.</para>
