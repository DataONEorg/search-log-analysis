Dry weight and the yields of 10-deacetyl baccatin III (10-DAB), taxol, and total taxanes per plant at 3 harvesting times were not significantly different between two strengths of JS, only the 11 month-old plants produced greater taxol in 1/20 JS. Great variations of these two parameters in 3 organs (leaves, stems and roots) of plants among 4 clones were found. Wx grew poorly and produced little taxanes. Nj11 grew fast with the greatest taxanes. T1 had growth rate similar to K3, but with greater taxanes. Nj11 was a 10-DAB rich clone, a 11 month-old plant produced 5.83 mg. Whereas T1 was the taxol rich clone, it produced 1.16 mg per plant. Usually 10-DAB was rich in needles, while taxol was rich in roots. However, T1’s needles contained taxol greater than its roots. The concentrations of both 10-DAB and taxol achieved the greatest amount in Dec than the other two harvesting months. Although 11 month-old plants gave the greatest biomass, the taxanes increased a little when compared to 9 month-old ones. Since most of potted plants died and grew poorly during the culture period, suggesting that water culture is a good tool to rapidly evaluate the clonal performance of Taiwan yew.

Each vessel (16 cm in diameter and 19.5 cm in height) was filled with 3.3 L of Johnson’s nutrient solution (JS solution, Epstein 1972). The concentrations of JS solution were adjusted to 1/10 and 1/20 strength of original salts. All the water used to dilute JS solution was de-ionized by resin filter and confirmed by the electrical conductivity. Each container planted 4 plants (Fig. 1b). A vessel was represented as a replication. Each concentration of JS solution was repeated 4 times. So each clones required 4 plants ×4 vessels ×2 concentrations of JS solution = 32 plants. The JS solution was discarded and replaced every 2 weeks with fresh solution. The air was pumped from the inlet filters located at the bottom of vessels at an interval of 15 min controlled by a timer.</para></section></description></methodStep><methodStep><description><section><title>Culture Environment</title><para>The plants were grown in a shelter with 60% light off at Taipei Botanical Garden.

At data collection date 4 plants of each clone were randomly taken from each vessel. Since taxane concentration and water content in different parts of a plant varied greatly, plants were separated as needle, stems (the total weight of needles and stem = shoot weight) and root parts, and were weighed respectively. Plants of each part were collected, grinded with methanol and determined concentrations of taxanes each as described below. The extracted residues were oven dried at 70℃ for two days as to be dry weights. Taxane yields per parts of a plant were calculated as the concentration of each component (ppm) times its dry weight, and then the total taxane yield per plant was obtained by adding together of all the yields of each part. The data were analyzed by GLM, SAS (SAS users Guide 1985) to evaluate the effect of the different clones, the concentrations of JS solution, and the culture period on the growth and taxane yield per plants.</para></section></description></methodStep><methodStep><description><section><title>Taxol analysis</title><para>Fresh samples were ground in methanol (20 mL) by homgenization and sonication as described in Ho et al. (2001 ). The extract was filtered and the filtrate was resuspended in 20 mL of the same solvent above. The two extracts were vacuum dried and partitioned in dichloromethane and water (40 mL each) twice. The dichloromethane fractions were vacuum dried, resuspended in methanol and filtered through a 0.2 µm TFT filter for HPLC analysis. 10-DAB, taxol and total taxanes (the sum of 10-DAB, baccatin, 10-deacetyl taxol, cephalomanine, taxol and 7-epi-10-deacetyltaxol) was determined following the procedure and the same HPLC as reported by Ho et al. (2001). Only the yields of 10-DAB, BC, taxol, and total taxanes (the sum of 6 components) per plant were analyzed by SAS to evaluate the changes during the culture period.</para></section></description><instrumentation>Perkin Elmer HPLC</instrumentation></methodStep></methods><access authSystem="knb" order="denyFirst"
