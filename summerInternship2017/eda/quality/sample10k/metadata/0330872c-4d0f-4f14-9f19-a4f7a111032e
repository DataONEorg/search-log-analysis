east-central Oklahoma. The Vamoosa-Ada aquifer is an important
source of water that underlies about 2,320-square miles of parts

Counties. Approximately 75 percent of the water withdrawn from
the Vamoosa-Ada aquifer is for municipal use. Rural domestic use
and water for stock animals account for most of the remaining

very thin limestones. The water-yielding capabilities of the

      <supplinf>Introduction --

This data set consists of digitized polygons of constant
hydraulic conductivity values for the Vamoosa-Ada aquifer in
east-central Oklahoma. The Vamoosa-Ada aquifer is an important
source of water that underlies about 2,320-square miles of parts
of Osage, Pawnee, Payne, Creek, Lincoln, Okfuskee, and Seminole
Counties. Approximately 75 percent of the water withdrawn from
the Vamoosa-Ada aquifer is for municipal use. Rural domestic use
and water for stock animals account for most of the remaining
water withdrawn. The Vamoosa-Ada aquifer is defined in a
ground-water report as consisting principally of the rocks of
the Late Pennsylvanian-age Vamoosa Formation and overlying Ada
Group. The Vamoosa-Ada aquifer consists of a complex sequence of
fine- to very fine-grained sandstone, siltstone, shale, and
conglomerate interbedded with very thin limestones. The
water-yielding capabilities of the aquifer are generally
controlled by lateral and vertical distribution of the sandstone
beds and their physical characteristics. The Vamoosa-Ada aquifer
is unconfined where it outcrops in about an 1,700-square-mile
area (D'Lugosz and others, 1986).

The Vamoosa Formation is underlain by the Tallant and Barnsdall
Formations in the northern part of the aquifer and the Hilltop
and Belle City Formations in the southern part of the aquifer.
The Ada Group in overlain by the Vanoss Group. The Vamoosa-Ada
aquifer is overlain by alluvial and terrace deposits in some
parts of the aquifer (Cederstrand, 1996a, 1996b, 1996c).

Recovery tests were performed on seven wells completed in the
confined part of the Vamoosa-Ada aquifer by D'Lugosz and others
(1986, p. 5) to determine some of the hydraulic properties of
the aquifer. Hydraulic-conductivity values were calculated from
these tests and ranged from 2 to 4 feet per day. A
hydraulic-conductivity value of 3 feet per day was used by
D'Lugosz and others (1986, p. 5) to compute values of
theoretical transmissivity for both the unconfined and confined
parts of the aquifer. A hydraulic-conductivity value of 3 feet
per day for the Vamoosa-Ada aquifer was used in this data set.

The Digital Line Graph (DLG) format requires numbers to be
stored as integers. Therefore, the hydraulic conductivity in
feet per day was multiplied by 10 and stored in the digital data
sets as tenths of a foot per day. For example 3 feet per day was
multiplied by 10 and stored in the digital data sets as 30
tenths of a foot per day. Geologic units other than the Vamoosa
Formation and Ada Group were given a value -99999 to indicate
hydraulic conductivity is not known.

The hydraulic conductivity of the alluvial and terrace deposits
of the North Canadian River, located in the southern part of the
Vamoosa-Ada aquifer, can be found in the report "Digital aquifer
characteristics of the alluvial and terrace deposits along the
North Canadian River from Oklahoma City to Eufaula Lake in
east-central Oklahoma," by Adams, Runkle, Rea, and Becker
(1997).

Most of the hydraulic conductivity polygons were extracted from
published digital geology data sets (Cederstrand, 1996a, 1996b,
1996c). The lines in the digital geology data sets were scanned
or digitized from maps published at a scale of 1:250,000 and
represent geologic contacts. Some of the lines were interpolated
in areas where the Vamoosa-Ada aquifer is overlain by alluvial
and terrace deposits near streams and rivers. A line
representing the contact between the Vamoosa Formation and the
Ada Group is included in this data set.

Reviews Applied to Data --

This electronic report was subjected to the same review standard
that applies to all U.S. Geological Survey reports. Reviewers
were asked to check the topological consistency, tolerances,
attribute frequencies and statistics, projection, and geographic
extent. Reviewers were given digital data sets and paper plots
for checking against the source maps to verify the linework and
attributes. The reviewers checked the metadata and a_readme.1st
files for completeness and accuracy.

Related Spatial and Tabular Data Sets --

This data set is one of four digital map data sets being published
together for this aquifer. The four data sets are:

&gt;              aqbound -  aquifer boundaries

&gt;              cond    -  hydraulic conductivity

&gt;              recharg -  aquifer recharge

&gt;              wlelev  -  water-level elevation contours

Digital map data sets of the Oklahoma surficial geology digitized from
1:250,000-scale maps (or 1:125,000-scale maps for the three Oklahoma
panhandle counties) are published separately.

        <procdesc>D'Lugosz and others,(1986) define the aquifer as, "*** that
part of the Vamoosa-Ada aquifer lying between the outcrop of
the base of the aquifer in the east and the approximate
location in the subsurface, projected to the surface, where
the aquifer contains water having a dissolved solids
concentration of 1,500 miiligrams per liter on the west." They
interpret the eastern boundary of the aquifer as underlying
the alluvial and terrace deposits where streams cross the
aquifer outcrop at the base of the Vamoosa Formation.

The outcrop area of the aquifer is important for purposes of
this investigation into ground-water vulnerability analysis.
The eastern boundary of the aquifer, the base of the Vamoosa
Formation, and the western boundary of the aquifer, the top of
the Ada Formation, are from the geologic formation boundaries
by Cederstrand (1996a, 1996b, 1996c), which is considered to be
the best available digital source. Where the formation
boundaries are overlain by alluvial and terrace deposits the
boundaries were projected across the streams from known
outcrops. Most of the projections are perpendicular to the
streams and for short distances across the alluvial and terrace
deposits. The projected lines were added to the outcrop
boundary lines on a computer monitor screen with an enlarged
image of the areas to enhance the detail.

    <overview>
      <eaover>Each polygon in this data set has an associated attribute, K,
containing values of hydraulic conductivity (D'Lugosz and
others, 1986) expressed in tenths of a foot per day.  For
example, a hydraulic conductivity of 3.0 feet per day would be
stored as a K value of 30. K is stored in the first major code
(MAJOR1 for polygons, and 0 is stored in the first minor code
(MINOR1) in the Digital Line Graph (DLG) version of this data set.

Each line in this digital data set has an associated attribute,
LSOURCE, that contains a code to indicate the source of the
line. An LSOURCE code of 1 indicates the line is from
Cederstrand (1996a, 1996b, 1996c). An LSOURCE code of 3
indicates the source of the line is the projection of the
boundary where the aquifer is overlain by alluvial or terrace
deposits. LSOURCE is stored in the first major code (MAJOR1) for
lines, and 0 is stored in the first minor code (MINOR1) in the
Digital Line Graph (DLG) version of this data set.
