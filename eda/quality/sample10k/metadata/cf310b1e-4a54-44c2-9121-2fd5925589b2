    <descript>
      <abstract>The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) mapped approximately 22 square miles of the Madison Swanson Marine Protected Area (MPA) and Steamboat Lumps MPA, which are located on the Florida shelf edge in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico in 2000 using sidescan sonar and high-resolution chirp seismic-reflection systems. This survey was conducted as part of a larger study of the effectiveness of no-fishing reserves in protecting grouper spawning aggregations. Field activity information for this cruise is available on-line through the U.S. Geological Survey Coastal and Marine Geoscience Data System at http://cmgds.marine.usgs.gov/fan_info.php?fa=2000-005-FA.</abstract>
      <purpose>The sidescan-sonar data were collected and processed during USGS field activity 2000-005-FA to map the surficial geology of the Steamboat Lumps Marine Protected Area.</purpose>

    <logic>This is a GeoTIFF image and associated world file of the data originally collected on field activity 2000-005-FA, recorded by ISIS acquisition system and processed while at sea. All files in this mosaic were acquired with a 400 meter swath width (200 meter range). These files were acquired with 12 dB of gain.</logic>
    <complete>This mosaic represents all of the processed backscatter data collected in the Steamboat Lumps Marine Protected Area during USGS field activity 2000-005-FA. The line numbers falling in this particular area are L54F1 to L1121F (which was intended to be L121F1). Also misnamed is L1120F1, which should have been L120F1. Line L122F1 is a tie line that runs southwest to northeast across the study area and is not included in the mosaic. L65F1 was missing a large section of navigation (45 minutes) so just straight extrapolation was used when mapping that file. L69F2 is actually outside the study area. Line 69 was continued in order to avoid a collision with another vessel. L82F1 was not processed  - the gear was pulled. The line was rerun as L82F2. During L102F1 navigation was lost after the Julian Day change. Navigation was manually created at 00:09, 00:19, and 00:29 based on the distance between points earlier in the line assuming a constant ship speed and direction. The turns are not included in the mosaic.</complete>

      <horizpa>
        <horizpar>Differential GPS, with an Ashtech BR2G beacon receiver, was used to navigate the ship.  The towfish navigation system was a Benthos DS 7000 acoustic deck set that used range to towfish to account for layback of the towfish. The position of the towfish was corrected using HYPACK and ISIS software. The range to fish did not always work well. The assumed approximate horizontal offset is 20-30 meters.</horizpar>

        <procdesc>XSonar processing software (Danforth and others, 1991) was used to process the sidescan sonar QMIPS files. The files were demultiplexed using a 4x3 sample interval and a normalization value of 8192. The scan size was 768 pixels, and the output resolution was 0.781250 meters. A command-line script was used to help remove surface noise. An example of the command line is: removeSurface -S20 -p10 -s10 -N10 -O0.6 -i l35f1. -o l35f1new. Manual bottom tracking was used in order to remove the water column from the swaths with the slant range correction. Destriping and beam angle corrections were applied using 300 lines with a 100 ping overlap; maximum beam angle of 90; response angle = 55; data normalization = 0; port/starboard tone adjust = ON. This processing effectively aids in suppressing speckle noise and reding file size, and corrects for slant-range distortion, signal attenuation, and dropped sonar pings. This process step and all subsequent process steps were performed by VeeAnn A. Cross.

        <procdesc>The individual lines were then processed with the WHIPS software package to additionally filter the lines using a 7 line filter and mapping the odd and even lines into separate georeferenced images for mosaicking in PCI software (Paskevich 1992; Paskevich 1996). These images had a pixel resolution of 1 meter/pixel.

        <procdesc>Non-overlapping swaths were then brought into the remote sensing software package PCI Geomatics. Two channels were used so that one channel (line by line) could be brought in and mapped - mosaicked - to the other channel by picking control points to further constrain the positioning of the line. The lines set as "true" were the even lines, and the odd lines were mapped to those using control points. The final mosaic was then exported from PCI as a TIFF image with an associated world file for georeferencing purposes. GeoTiffExamine was then used to add the world file information to the TIFF image transforming it into a GeoTIFF.</procdesc>
