      <abstract>These data were collected under a cooperative agreement between the Massachusetts Office of Coastal Zone Management (CZM) and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), Coastal and Marine Geology Program, Woods Hole Coastal and Marine Science Center (WHCMSC). Initiated in 2003, the primary objective of this program is to develop regional geologic framework information for the management of coastal and marine resources. Accurate data and maps of sea floor geology are important first steps toward protecting fish habitat, delineating marine resources, and assessing environmental changes due to natural or human impacts. The project is focused on the inshore waters of coastal Massachusetts, primarily in water depths of 5 to 30 meters (m) deep. Data collected for the mapping cooperative have been released in a series of USGS Open-File Reports (http://woodshole.er.usgs.gov/project-pages/coastal_mass/). The geophysical data were collected during a survey in 2013 during USGS Field Activity 2013-003-FA (http://cmgds.marine.usgs.gov/fan_info.php?fa=2013-003-FA) and cover approximately 185 square kilometers of the inner continental shelf.</abstract>
      <purpose>These data are used to define sea-floor morphology as part of the Massachusetts Seafloor Mapping Project.  This gridded bathymetry layer and depth-colored hillshaded image represents approximately 185 square kilometers of interferometric sonar (Systems Engineering and Assessment Ltd. SWATHPlus-M) bathymetry data collected by the U.S. Geological Survey during USGS survey 2013-003-FA in 2013 offshore of Massachusetts, south of Martha's Vineyard and north of Nantucket.  An additional approximately 50 square kilometers of interferometric bathymetry data was collected north of Nantucket during the same survey.</purpose>

    <logic>This bathymetric surface represents interpolated data at 5-meter per pixel resolution. Bathymetric data were processed to account for gaps that occurred along-track and between adjacent lines.  Quality control and data processing were conducted to remove spurious points and reduce speed of sound artifacts (refraction). Soundings from the surveys were processed and edited using Computer Aided Resource Information System (CARIS) Hydrographic Information Processing System (HIPS; vers. 8.0, 8.1 and 9.0). Although the soundings were edited, small data spikes may still exist. While much effort was devoted to cleaning the data and minimizing survey artifacts, some artifacts may still be seen in the final gridded bathymetric surface including an along track artifact at nadir (the ship track) and at the far edges of a survey line where adjacent swaths overlap.  These artifacts are especially noticeable in areas of little local relief.</logic>
    <complete>Nearly all quality main survey line bathymetric data (generally shore parallel) that were collected within the survey areas south of Martha's Vineyard and north of Nantucket were incorporated in this bathymetric surface.
Tielines and transit lines were generally excluded from this bathymetric surface, especially if equal or higher quality main survey line data were available.  The tieline and transit line data were used to verify tide corrections during post-processing. Line L1f1 was heavily edited due to navigation errors and issues with staying on the survey line. The line was restarted as L1f2, and much of the end of line L1f1 was discarded in swath editing.  Time gaps occurred during this field activity where no surveying was done due to bad weather, rough seas and stops in port for crew changes.  Planned surveying was paused and no main survey line data were collected during these times:
&gt;JD143 15:20 - JD146 20:06 (no data were collected on JD144 or JD145)
&gt;JD149 15:40 - JD151 18:59 (no data were collected on JD150)
&gt;JD153 00:01 - JD153 14:32
&gt;JD155 18:16 - JD156 02:06

        <horizpar>USGS Field Activity 2013-003-FA:  Navigation was acquired with a Coda Octopus F185R Real-time Kinematic Global Positioning System (RTK-GPS); which is accurate to less than 1 meter (typically on the order of centimeters) horizontally.  The SWATHPlus transducers were mounted on a rigid pole, approximately 2.17 m below the water line, along the port side of the M/V Scarlett Isabella.  The RTK-GPS antenna was located on the same pole approximately 4.6 m above the sea surface.  These offsets were corrected within the SWATHPlus acquisition software.</horizpar>

        <vertaccr>USGS Field Activity 2013-003-FA:  Vertical accuracy of the raw data based on system specifications may approximate 1% of water depth, 0.1 to 0.4 meters within the survey area. However, overall vertical accuracies on the order of 50-cm or better are assumed based on the following considerations:  The Coda Octopus F185R Attitude and Positioning system, used to correct for vessel roll, pitch, heave, and yaw, has a theoretical vertical accuracy of a few mm.  Tidal offsets were corrected to MLLW using Real-Time Kinematic GPS (RTK-GPS) heights in post-processing (see process steps). Corrections were sent via cellular modem and VHF radio to the ship from the base station on land.  The primary reference station is located at the USGS Marine Operations Facility (MOF) in Falmouth, MA. USGS field tests (unpublished) using submerged targets suggest that the vertical accuracy of the RTK-GPS tidal correction is less than 30cm. Refraction artifacts were minimized by acquiring a range of sound velocity profiles with an ODIM MVP30 moving vessel profiler (until ~0550UTC on JD 156) and a hand-casted AML Oceanographic MinosX sound velocimeter (for the duration of survey 2013-003-FA).  Sound velocity data are entered into the SWATHPlus acquisition software to model the sound velocity structure of the water column.  Gridding algorithms and cell sizes for these data could introduce errors as great as 3m along the edges of the data, but gridding-induced errors are likely much smaller (less than 20-cm) for most of the survey area. Changes in ship draft due to water and fuel usage were not considered.</vertaccr>

        <srccontr>USGS Field Activity 2013-003-FA:  A 234 kHz Systems Engineering and Assessment Ltd. (SEA) SWATHplus interferometric sonar was mounted on the port side of the M/V Scarlett Isabella.  Data were acquired during May and June 2013.
USGS Configuration:
Survey: Survey lines were run at an average speed of 5 knots and were generally spaced 100 m apart to obtain overlapping swaths of data and full sea-floor coverage.
Sonar: The SEA SWATHplus-M operates at a frequency of 234 kHz and a variable range (increased or decreased manually depending on water depth).  The system was operated with a transmit power: 80 percent, a transmit length: 43 cycles, 4096 samples per channel, ping rate of 15 per second.
Speed of Sound: Sound-velocity profiles were collected approximately every 2 hours using an ODIM MVP30 moving vessel profiler or a hand-casted AML Oceanographic MinosX sound velocimeter.
Tides: Tides were corrected during post-processing using two-minute interval averages of the RTK tide data recorded in the "TID" message string of the HYPACK navigation file for each survey line. VDatum transformation grid &#8220;MENHMAgome01_8301&#8221; was used within the HYPACK software for the kinematic tide correction process during 2013-003-FA to offset water level heights from the WGS84 ellipsoid to MLLW.  See the HYPACK navigation files metadata for additional information "2013-003-FA_HYPACK_meta.xml" available from the larger work citation.
Remaining artifacts: While much effort was devoted to cleaning the data and minimizing survey artifacts, some artifacts may still be seen in the final gridded bathymetric surface including an along track artifact at nadir (the ship track) and at the far edges of a survey line where adjacent swaths overlap.  These artifacts are especially noticeable in areas of little local relief.</srccontr>

      <procstep>
        <procdesc>1. Raw to Processed conversion for USGS field activity 2013-003-FA: Each raw SWATHPlus bathymetric sonar file (SXR) was converted to SWATHPlus processed file (SXP) using SEA SWATHPlus Swath Processor (ver. 3.07.17).  During the conversion process, sound velocity profiles were used to minimize potential refraction artifacts from fluctuations in the speed of sound within the water column. Several bathymetric filters were applied to remove erroneous soundings and reduce the density of the data. Predicted tidal information was merged into the processed file (SXP) during this conversion, however final tidal corrections were applied later in the processing flow.  Bathymetric filtering typically included low amplitude (100%), range (0-4m), box (3-50m depth, 1.5-75m horizontal), median (window size 5), alongtrack 1 (depth difference of 5-m, window size 5-m, and learn rate of 0.7), alongtrack 2 (depth difference of 1.5-m, window size 1m, and learn rate of 0.9), and mean filters (0.25m).  These represent the typical parameters used for the majority of the survey but slight adjustments were required for some areas. This process step and all subsequent process steps were performed by the same person - Seth Ackerman.</procdesc>

        <procdesc>2. CARIS processing for USGS field activity 2013-003-FA: A new CARIS HIPS project (ver. 8.0) was created for this field activity with projection information set to Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) Zone 19, WGS84. Each SWATHPlus processed file (sxp) was imported to the new CARIS project using the Import/Conversion Wizard. A 5 meter resolution Bathymetric and Statistical Error (BASE) Surface was created from the files for each Julian day. The BASE surface for each day was reviewed for any inconsistencies or data anomalies. Navigation was reviewed and edited as needed using the navigation editor tool. Beam-to-beam slopes and across track angle filters were applied to the soundings line by line. The refraction editor was used to adjust sound speed values in areas where velocimeter data did not adequately correct depth profiles obviously influenced by local anomalies in speed of sound through the water column.  Preliminary processing was done during the survey and additional processing was done post-survey with CARIS HIPS and SIPS versions 8.0, 8.1 and 9.0. This process step was done between 2013 and 2015.</procdesc>

        <procdesc>3. Prepare and apply RTK Tide data for USGS field activity 2013-003-FA: A tidal correction file was created during post-processing by applying a two-minute moving median filter to the RTK tide data recorded in the "TID" message string of the raw HYPACK navigation files.  The TID messages from device 1 (DEV 1; which was the NovAtel DL-V3 GPS receiver) were extracted using a shell script called web_novTid_movmed and a Python script called tid_movmed.py.  Only HYPACK extracted tide data were used for this survey.  RTK tide corrections were loaded and applied to the soundings line by line in CARIS, resulting in bathymetric values referenced to MLLW.  Each line was re-merged and the preliminary BASE surfaces were recomputed to incorporate the new tide information.  Additional swath editing was done in CARIS using the swath and area based editors to remove any additional inconsistencies and minimize survey artifacts. This process step was done between 2013 and 2015.</procdesc>

        <procdesc>4. Final BASE surface creation and export:  Three separate 5-meter BASE surfaces were created for the (1) east-west trending lines south of Martha's Vineyard; (2) the north-south trending lines south of Martha's Vineyard and east of Noman's Land; and (3) the area north of Nantucket utilizing all the quality bathymetric soundings data from the survey. An interpolation algorithm was run on each of these BASE surfaces in CARIS HIPS/SIPS to fill small gaps between lines. The BASE surfaces were then combined in CARIS HIPS using the Tools -&gt; Surfaces -&gt; Combine tool (overlapping areas results in the shoalest depth in the resulting surface).  The final surface was then exported from CARIS as 32-bit GeoTIFF and as hillshaded GeoTIFF image. Except for setting the sun angle to 40 degrees above the horizon and the vertical exaggeration to 5x, the default hillshade settings were used to create the hillshaded GeoTIFF image. This process step was done between 2015 and 2016.</procdesc>

    <overview>
      <eaover>There are no attributes associated with a GeoTIFF however the pixel values of the 32-bit image are depth values. The "no data" value is set to 3.402823e+038. Data values represent depth in meters referenced to mean lower low water (MLLW).  The color-ramp of the hillshade bathymetry image is full visual spectrum from red to purple representing shallow (less than 10 meters) to deep (approximately 30 meters), respectively. The "no data" value in the hillshaded image is RGB value: 0,0,0.</eaover>

    <resdesc>USGS data release 2013-003-FA bathymetry from south of Martha's Vineyard and north of Nantucket (2013-003-FA_Bathy.zip). The zip file contains a folder with the the 32-bit Floating Point GeoTIFF image (2013-003-FA_Bath5m_MLLW.tif) with a world file (2013-003-FA_Bath5m_MLLW.tfw). A depth-colored hillshade bathymetry image (2013-003-FA_BathHlshd5m.tif) with a world file (2013-003-FA_BathHlshd5m.tfw) and metadata files in three standard formats are also included in the zip file.  The pixel values in the depth-colored hillshade bathymetry image DO NOT correspond to depths.  The pixel values of the 32-bit Floating Point GeoTIFF image are depth values.</resdesc>

    <techpreq>The ZIP file contains a 32-bit Floating Point GeoTIFF image compressed using the DEFLATE compression format with a world file. To utilize these data an image processing or GIS software package capable of viewing a 32-bit Floating Point GeoTIFF image with DEFLATE compression. Standard image viewing software cannot translate a 32-bit floating point GeoTIFF image.  The depth-colored hillshade GeoTIFF image is 32-bit GeoTIFF with LZW compression which can be viewed in any image processing or GIS software package capable of viewing a 32-bit GeoTIFF image with LZW compression.</techpreq>
