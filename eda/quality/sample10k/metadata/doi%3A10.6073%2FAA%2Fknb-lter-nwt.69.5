One of these is on  Niwot Ridge at C-1, located approximately 1.6 km, by road, from the  University of Colorado Mountain Research Station at an approximate  elevation of 3000 meters. The Snotel installations operate on the  principle that the snowpack exerts pressure on liquid-filled stainless  steel &quot;pillows&quot; that rest on the ground. Pressure transducers output a  digital signal that is sent via radio telemetry to one of two receiving  stations. The transducer output is calibrated by measuring snowpack  depth and density on or about the 25th of each month from December  through April. A Mt. Rose snow sampler was used to determine the depth  and density of the snowpack at each of the &quot;pillow&apos;s&quot; four corners.   These four values were averaged to determine the monthly snow water  equivalent (SWE) in inches.</para></abstract><keywordSet><keyword>NWT</keyword><keyword>Niwot Ridge LTER Site</keyword><keyword>LTER</keyword><keyword>Colorado</keyword><keyword>climate</keyword><keyword>weather</keyword><keyword>meteorology</keyword><keyword>Snotel</keyword><keyword>snow</keyword><keyword>snow water equivalen</keyword></keywordSet><distribution scope="document"><online><url function="download">http://culter.colorado.edu/exec/.extracttoolA?c-1swequ.ml</url></online></distribution><coverage scope="document"><temporalCoverage scope="document"><rangeOfDates><beginDate><calendarDate>1981-11-02</calendarDate></beginDate><endDate><calendarDate>2008-01-02</calendarDate></endDate></rangeOfDates></temporalCoverage><geographicCoverage scope="document"><geographicDescription></geographicDescription><boundingCoordinates><westBoundingCoordinate>-105.643</westBoundingCoordinate><eastBoundingCoordinate>-105.3753</eastBoundingCoordinate><northBoundingCoordinate>40.0615</northBoundingCoordinate><southBoundingCoordinate>39.9932</southBoundingCoordinate></boundingCoordinates></geographicCoverage></coverage><maintenance><description><para>The initial iteration of the documentation section of this file was generated by Mark Losleben and Rick Ingersoll in mid-January 1995.
