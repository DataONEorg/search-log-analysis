      <abstract>

This data set represents the amount of fresh surface water
withdrawal for irrigation, in megaliters per day, in the
conterminous United States.

The data set was used as an input data layer for a national
model to predict nitrate concentration in ground water used for
drinking.

Nolan and Hitt (2006) developed two national models to predict
contamination of ground water by nonpoint sources of
nitrate. The nonlinear approach to national-scale Ground-WAter
Vulnerability Assessment (GWAVA) uses components representing
nitrogen (N) sources, transport, and attenuation.

One model (GWAVA-S) predicts nitrate contamination of shallow
(typically less than 5 meters deep), recently recharged ground
water, which may or may not be used for drinking.  The other
(GWAVA-DW) predicts ambient nitrate concentration in deeper
supplies used for drinking.

This data set is one of 14 data sets (1 output data set and 13
input data sets) associated with the GWAVA-DW model. Full details
of the model development are in Nolan and Hitt (2006).

For inputs to the model, spatial attributes representing 13
nitrogen loading and transport and attenuation factors were
compiled as raster data sets (1-km by 1-km grid cell size) for
the conterminous United States (see table 1).

      <purpose>

This particular data layer was created to help characterize
nitrogen attenuation factors at a national level for input to a
national model to predict nitrate concentration in ground water
used for drinking.

Nitrate is considered to be the most widespread contaminant in
ground water. High nitrate concentration in ground water is a
concern for human health, and protecting drinking water sources
is a national priority.  The U.S. Geological Survey's National
Water-Quality Assessment (NAWQA) Program monitors the occurrence
and distribution of nitrate and other contaminants in ground
water and streams. However, because monitoring everywhere for
the occurrence and distribution of nitrate in ground water is
impractical, national water-quality models are used to address
data gaps. The goal of the current study was to predict ground
water vulnerability to nitrate at the national scale, to
complement measured data.

Water-quality data used in this study were collected during
1991-2003 and represent the first full decade of sampling by the
NAWQA program. The input data layers describe conditions in the
mid 1990's, and so the predictions represent mid 1990's land-use
and nitrogen-loading conditions.

This spatial data set is one of a group of data sets developed
specifically for use in a national model of nitrate in ground
water.  The data set should be used at the national or regional
level, not at the local level.

Users should consider the various assumptions that went into
generating each spatial data set and the limitations inherent in
the source data materials in deciding whether the data set is
appropriate for use in other national or regional applications.

Please acknowledge the U.S. Geological Survey in products derived
from these data.

NLCD 92 (National Land Cover Dataset 1992) is a 21-category
land cover classification scheme that has been applied
consistently over the conterminous United States. It is based
primarily on the unsupervised classification of Landsat TM
(Thematic Mapper) 1992 imagery. Ancillary data sources
included topography, census, agricultural statistics, soil
characteristics, other land cover maps, and wetlands data. The
NLCD 92 classification is provided as raster data with a
spatial resolution of 30 meters.

A 30-m spatial resolution version of this land use and land
cover (LULC) data set was used to develop an enhanced version
of the NLCD 92 (called NLCDE 92) at 30-meter and 1-kilometer
resolutions using methods described in:

Nakagaki, N., and Wolock, D.M., 2005, Estimation of
agricultural pesticide use in drainage basins using land cover
maps and county pesticide data:  U.S. Geological Survey
Open-File Report 2005-1188, pp.4-10.

The LULC data were derived from aerial photography, and NLCD
92 data were derived from satellite imagery. The NLCD was
modified with selected land-use categories of LULC, as
described in Nakagaki and Wolock (2005), because LULC data are
a better source for some land categories that are difficult to
distinguish using only satellite imagery (residential,
orchards/vineyards/other, and tundra). The enhanced NLCD
(NLCDE 92) includes 21 land-cover classifications from the
original NLCD 92 plus an additional four categories from the
LULC (LULC tundra, NLCD/LULC forested residential, LULC
residential, and LULC orchards/vineyards/other) (Nakagaki and
Wolock, 2005).

The 30-m resolution NLCDE 92 was used to create a set of 25
1-km resolution national grids of "percentage" land cover (one
grid for each land cover class) using methods described in
Nakagaki and Wolock (2005), pages 10-13.

In each 1-km resolution national grid, the value of a grid
cell was the percentage of the 1 km by 1 km area specific to
that land cover class. For example, the grid of "pasture/hay"
indicated the percentage of pasture/hay in each cell, and the
grid of "row crops" indicated the percentage of row crops in
each cell.

Spatial data sets representing nitrogen (N) loading and
transport and attenuation factors were compiled for the
conterminous United States.

N source variables include farm fertilizer, manure from
confined animal feeding operations, and loading surrogates
that reflect additional sources of N. For example, population
density is a surrogate for nonagricultural sources of N from
septic tanks, sewers, and domestic animal waste in urban
areas.

Transport factors include water input, sediments, rock type,
and selected management practices.  "Water input" is an
interaction term expressed as the ratio of the total area of
irrigated land to precipitation.  Attenuation factors include
variables that are surrogates for dilution and/or
denitrification.

Each of the variables in the model was compiled within 1-km by
1-km grid cells for prediction of nitrate concentration at the
national scale.

A national grid of 1995 fresh surface water withdrawal for
irrigation was generated by adding a spatial component to
tabular county estimates of fresh surface water withdrawal for
irrigation presented in Solley and others (1998). Mapped
agricultural land cover from NLCDE 92 1-km resolution GRIDS
was used to spatially refine the geographic location of
irrigation water withdrawal from countywide tables to
agricultural land within a county.

In each NLCDE 92 1-km resolution national grid, the value of a
grid cell was the percentage of the 1 km by 1 km area specific
to that land cover class.  If a 1-km2 cell contained 78
percent agricultural land, this translated to .78 km2 of
agricultural land in the cell.

Agricultural land where irrigation was applied was defined as
the sum of these six percentage land cover classifications
from NLCDE 92:

&gt;Code     Land cover classification
&gt; 61      Orchards/vineyards/other
&gt; 62      LULC orchards/vineyards/other
&gt; 81      Pasture/hay
&gt; 82      Row crops
&gt; 83      Small grains
&gt; 84      Fallow

The assumption was that surface water withdrawals were spread
equally among these land cover categories.

A 1-km resolution national grid of fresh surface water
withdrawal for fresh surface water withdrawal was generated
using steps similar to those used to generate a 1-km
resolution pesticide use grid described in Nakagaki and Wolock
(2005), pages 17-20.  The steps were:

1. Compute the county area of NLCDE 92 agricultural land cover
classifications in each county in the conterminous United
States.

a. The 1-km grid of percent values of agricultural land
was converted to a grid of km2 of agricultural land by
dividing the value of each cell (percent) by 100.

b. The area of agricultural land was summed for each county
by overlaying the cell values (km2) of the areal grid with
a 1-km resolution county grid.

2. Compute the county "intensity" (or "rate") of surface water
withdrawal for each county in the conterminous United
States.

The "intensity" was computed by dividing the surface water
withdrawal of the county (km2) by the county area of
agricultural land computed in step 1b (km2).

The "intensity" data was linked to the 1-km national county
grid using county FIPS codes.

3. Create a national grid of estimated surface water
withdrawal.

The cell values of the areal grid of km2 of agricultural
land (step 1a) were multiplied by the cell values of the
areal grid of county surface water withdrawal "intensity"
(step 2).  The cell values of the final grid represent the
Mgal/day of surface water withdrawal in each 1 km by 1 km
cell.

Here is an example of how surface water withdrawal for
one 1-km2 cell in Pierce County, Nebraska (FIPS 31119) was
generated:

&gt;Step 1a. Percent of NLCDE 92 ag land in cell = 13, so the
&gt;amount of NLCDE 92 ag land in cell = .13 km2
&gt;
&gt;Step 1b. Total area of NLCDE 92 ag land in county = 1,302.17 km2
&gt;
&gt;Step 2. Total surface water withdrawal in county = 2.85
&gt;Mgal/day (from Solley and others, 1998)
&gt;
&gt;County "intensity" = 2.85 Mgal/day / 1,302.17 km2 = .0022
&gt;Mgal/day per km2
&gt;Step 3. Amount of surface water withdrawal in cell = .13
&gt;km2 * .0022 Mgal/day per km2 = .00028 Mgal/day
&gt;
&gt;The sum of surface water withdrawal calculated for all
&gt;cells in Pierce County, Nebraska (FIPS 31119) equals 2.85
&gt;Mgal/day.

These steps were repeated for all cells nationwide to generate
a 1-km resolution national grid. Each cell value represented
the amount of fresh surface water withdrawal in the cell in
Mgal/day.  The values were converted to megaliters per day
(MLD) by multiplying each value by 3.785.

To make the national map of predicted nitrate concentration,
the values from the 1-km by 1-km grid cells for each of the
input data layers were put in to the model equation to
calculate a predicted concentration for each output cell.  An
output cell was assigned a value of "no data" if any of the
corresponding input data cells at that location was "no data."

The following ArcInfo Workstation GRID commands produced the
predicted nitrate concentration grid:

GRID cells were randomly selected from this data set and were
checked by hand to ensure the correct values were calculated
using the model equation and the input data layers.

Areas with high N load, low to moderate clay content,
sufficient water input, and low denitrification potential have
the highest predicted nitrate concentration in ground water
and therefore may be vulnerable to nitrate contamination.  The
most extensive areas of predicted, severe contamination
(nitrate greater than 10 mg/L) occur in the High Plains, and
areas of predicted, moderate contamination (more than 5 to 10
mg/L nitrate) occur extensively in the northern Midwest.

Each 1-km by 1-km grid cell stores the amount of fresh surface
water withdrawal, in megaliters per day.

Data Type:            Floating Point
Minimum Value =                0.000
Maximum Value =               11.115
Mean          =                0.041
Standard Deviation =           0.263

The grid is floating point; a VAT is not present.

In the ASCII text file, "no data" is indicated as -9999.
