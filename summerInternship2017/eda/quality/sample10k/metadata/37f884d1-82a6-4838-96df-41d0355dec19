      <abstract>This geospatial data set describes bedrock geology of the
Turkey Creek drainage basin in Jefferson County, Colorado.
It was digitized from maps of fault locations and geologic
map units based on age and lithology.  Created for use in
the Jefferson County Mountain Ground-Water Resources Study,
it is to be used at a scale no more detailed than 1:50,000.
			</abstract>
      <purpose>This data set was created for analysis of the ground-water
system of the study area.
			</purpose>
      <supplinf>The source materials for the generation of this data set
consist of bedrock geology mapped on U.S. Geological Survey
(USGS) topographic quadrangles at a scale of 1:24,000 by the
USGS.  The source materials were converted to digital format,
topologically developed, and attributed on a quadrangle-by-
quadrangle basis before being combined into one data set.

The procedures for converting the materials to digital format
differed for each quadrangle and are summarized as follows:

Conifer

The original camara-ready transparency of the map publication,
Reconnaissance Geologic Map of the Conifer Quadrangle,
Jefferson County, Colorado, was obtained from the USGS.  A
film-positive was made from this transparency.  To simplify
the linework, this film-positive was then traced by hand onto
mylar.  The mylar was then digitally scanned at 300 dots per
inch (dpi) and stored as a TIFF image.  Using Arc/INFO software
from Environmental Systems Research Institute, the image was
georeferenced to real-world coordinates and converted into
an Arc/INFO raster data set format known as a grid, which was
then vectorized into an Arc/INFO vector data set format known
as a coverage.  A quadrangle boundary outline that was
generated from quadrangle boundary coordinates and then
projected into real-world coordinates was added to the coverage,
which was then converted to a coverage with polygon topology.
Line features in the coverage were attributed according to
fault type classification, and the polygon features were
attributed according to bedrock geologic map unit and fault
zone classification.

Evergreen

An incomplete collection of the original pre-press mylar
separates for the map publication, Geologic Map of the
Evergreen Quadrangle, Jefferson County, Colorado, was
obtained from the USGS.  Mylar separates of Quaternary
geologic contacts and faults were identified and digitally
scanned at 300 dpi into TIFF images.  All other geologic
contacts in the area of interest were traced onto mylar from
a paper print of the map publication.  Furthermore, an
enclosing polygon outline outside of the area of interest
was drawn on the mylar so that the traced contacts would form
polygon features.  The mylar was then digitally scanned at
300 dpi into a TIFF image.  All the images were then
georeferenced to real-world coordinates, converted into grids,
and vectorized into three separate coverages, one for each
of the two mylar sources, and one for the traced source.
These coverages were then combined into one coverage.  One
of the authors of the map publication provided updated
nomenclature for Precambrian map units (Bruce Bryant, U.S.
Geological Survey, oral communication, 1998) so that the
nomenclature would match that of adjacent quadrangles.  The
line features in the coverage were attributed according to
fault type, and polygon features were attributed according
to geologic map unit and fault zone classification.

Indian Hills

A paper print of the map publication, Geologic Map of the
Indian Hills Quadrangle, Jefferson County, Colorado, was
obtained from the USGS.  For the area of interest on the
quadrangle, two mylars were hand-traced from this paper print.
One mylar consisted of geologic contacts and an enclosing
polygon outline outside of the area of interest that was
drawn so that the contacts would form polygon features.  The
other mylar consisted of fault traces.  The two mylars were
then digitally scanned at 300 dpi into TIFF images.  These
images were georeferenced to real-world coordinates and
converted into grids which were then vectorized into coverages.
The coverages were then combined into one coverage.  One of
the authors of the map publication provided updated nomencla-
ture for Precambrian map units (Bruce Bryant, U.S. Geological
Survey, oral communication, 1998) so that the nomenclature
would match that of adjacent quadrangles.  Line features in
the coverage were attributed according to fault type, and
polygon features were attributed according to geologic map
unit and fault zone classification.

Meridian Hill

A paper photocopy of preliminary geologic mapping consisting of
faults and geologic contacts for the Meridian Hill Quadrangle,
Clear Creek, Jefferson, and Park Counties, was obtained from
the USGS.  For the area of interest on this quadrangle, all
the linework was traced onto mylar.  Furthermore, an enclosing
polygon outline outside of the area of interest was drawn on
the mylar so that the traced contacts would form polygon
features.   The mylar was then digitally scanned at 300 dpi
into a TIFF image.  The image was georeferenced to real-world
coordinates and converted into a grid which was then vectorized
into a coverage.  Line features in the coverage were then
attributed according to fault type, and the polygon features
were attributed according to geologic map unit and fault zone
classification.

Morrison

The original pre-press mylar separates for the map publication
Geologic Map of the Morrison Quadrangle, Jefferson County,
Colorado, were obtained from the USGS.  The mylar separate
of geologic contacts was digitally scanned at 300 dpi into a
TIFF image.  This image was georeferenced to real-world
coordinates and converted into a grid which was then vectorized
into a coverage.  The fault linework was digitized into a
coverage from another mylar separate of the same publication
that had too many other themes on it and was therefore too
difficult to scan and vectorize.  The fault coverage was then
transformed to real-world coordinates.  The coverages were
then combined into one coverage.  An enclosing polygon outline
outside of the area of interest was digitized into the coverage
so that the geologic contacts would form polygon features.
Line features in the coverage were attributed according to
fault type, and polygons were attributed according to geologic
map unit and fault zone classification.

Once the polygon and vector topology was developed for each
quadrangle, the individual coverages were combined into one
coverage.  No edgematching was performed.  A study-area
outline of the Turkey Creek Watershed was delineated in
Arc/INFO with USGS Digital Elevation Model data sets.  A
500-meter buffer polygon of this outline was used to clip
the geology coverage.

    <useconst>The scale of the source materials for this data set was
1:24,000.  However, due to the nature of bedrock geologic
mapping, fault and contact locations will not be as precise as
other, more easily-located cartographic features.  Furthermore,
materials for the Meridian Hill Quadrangle, while compiled at
a scale of 1:24,000, were intended for publication at 1:500,000.

    <complete>Because no exact linear feature was used to delineate areas
that are intruded by small quartz-monzonite bodies on the
source materials, these areas were not recorded in this
coverage.  All other contacts and fault traces were recorded.

        <horizpar>Paper hardcopies of the data set were plotted at the same

to ensure a level of accuracy required for the study.
The digital linework is accurate to +/- 7 meters.

of arc

RPOLY#: internal unique integer number of polygon to right
of arc

LENGTH: length of arc in meters

GEOL_TC#: internal unique integer feature number

GEOL_TC-ID: user-defined integer feature number

FLT: fault indicator, Y for fault, N for none

FLTTYPE: fault location certainty indicator, K for known,
C for concealed, A for approximate, N for none

EDGE: quadrangle boundary indicator, 1 for edge, 0 for not
