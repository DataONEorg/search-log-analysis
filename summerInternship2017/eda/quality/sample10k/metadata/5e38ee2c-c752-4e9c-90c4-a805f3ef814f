      <abstract>The Tillamook Bay subbasins and Nehalem River basins encompass 1,369 and 2,207 respective square kilometers of northwestern Oregon and drain to the Pacific Ocean. The Tillamook, Trask, Wilson, Kilchis, and Miami Rivers flow into Tillamook Bay near the towns of Tillamook and Garibaldi. The Wilson and Trask River basins cover the largest areas (500 and 451 square kilometers, respectively) whereas the Tillamook and Kilchis Rivers encompass similar sized areas (156 and 169 square kilometers, respectively) and the Miami River the smallest area (94 square kilometers). In cooperation with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the U.S. Geological Survey completed a reconnaissance-level assessment of channel condition and bed-material transport relevant to the permitting of in-stream gravel extraction along the the major alluvial portions of six river systems, including the lowermost 14.1 km of the Tillamook River, 16.3 km of the Trask River, 15.2 km of the Wilson River, 7.8 km of the Kilchis River, 11.6 km of the Miami River, and 31.4 km of the Nehalem River. To support these analyses, digital channel maps were produced to depict channel and floodplain conditions in the Tillamook Bay sub-basins and Nehalem River basin from different time periods. GIS layers defining the wetted channel and bar features and channel centerline in the study area were developed for four time periods: 1939, 1967, 2005, and 2009. For this project, the active channel was defined as area typically inundated during annual high flows, and includes the low-flow channel as well as side channels, islands, and channel-flanking gravel bars. The wetted channel and bar feature datasets were developed by digitizing from aerial photographs. Aerial photographs from 1939 and 1967 were scanned, rectified, and mosaicked for this project (See metadata for each photograph set for more information on the rectification process and resolution of each dataset). Digital orthophotographs from 2005 and 2009 are publicly available.</abstract>
      <purpose>These data were created to support preliminary assessment of channel stability and bed-material transport on Tillamook, Trask, Wilson, Kilchis, Miami, and Nehalem Rivers, northwest Oregon. This mapping was used to track changes in channel morphology and planform over time.</purpose>

    <logic>Data are topologically correct in ArcGIS. Topolgy rules were used to edit features and verify that polygons were completely enclosed or did not overlap.</logic>
    <complete>Data are complete. Wetted channel and bar feature mapping was reviewed by a minimum of three other team members to ensure protocol was followed and that mapping was consistent between time periods. Digitizing was done at a scale of 1:2,000 in the Tillamook Bay sub-basins and upstream of river kilometer 19.0 on the Nehalem River. Downstream of river kilometer 19.0 on the Nehalem River, digitizing was completed at a scale of 1:10,000. All bar and wetted channel features greater than 200 square meters were digitized. Because polygons were split for assignment to study reaches, some may represent areas less than 200 square meters. Best judgment was used to delineate feature boundaries where obscured by vegetation or shadows.</complete>
    <posacc>
      <horizpa>
        <horizpar>The 1939 and 1967 photographs of the six study areas were georectified using 5 to 14 ground-control points. The total root mean square error of rectified photographs, an indicator of the horizontal position uncertainties owing to the georectification process, was less than 4.9 m for all study areas. Generally, ground-control points for georectification were located near the mainstem channels so that positional errors for channel features should be less than the root mean square error reported for individual photographs. Digitizing was done at a scale of 1:2,000 in the Tillamook Bay sub-basins and upstream of river kilometer 19.0 on the Nehalem River. Downstream of river kilometer 19.0 on the Nehalem River, digitizing was completed at a scale of 1:10,000.</horizpar>
