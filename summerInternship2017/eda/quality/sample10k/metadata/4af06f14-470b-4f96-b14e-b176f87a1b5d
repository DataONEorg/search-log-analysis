      <purpose>This data set was created as part of the Black Hills Hydrology
Study (BHHS). The BHHS is a long-term investigation that was
initiated in 1990 as a cooperative effort between the
U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the South Dakota Department of
Environment and Natural Resources (DENR), and the West Dakota
Water Development District. West Dakota represents various
local and county cooperators. The purpose of the study is to
assess the quantity, quality, and distribution of surface and
ground water in the Black Hills area of western South Dakota
(Driscoll, 1992). The study area includes parts of Butte,
Custer, Fall River, Lawrence, Meade, and Pennington counties
in South Dakota.

      <supplinf>Reviews_Applied_to_Data:
This electronic report was subjected to the same review
standard that applies to all U.S. Geological Survey
reports. Reviewers were asked to check the topological
consistency, tolerances, attribute frequencies and statistics,
projection, and geographic extent. The reviewers checked the
metadata and a_readme.1st files for completeness and accuracy.

Related_Spatial_and_Tabular_Data_Sets:
Geologic structure contours for the tops of the Deadwood,
Madison, Minnelusa, and Minnekahta geologic units (ddwdscon,
mdsnscon, mnlsscon, mnktscon) and data set of wells with
geologic information (inkrswpt) for the Inyan Kara
Group. Digital data set of where the Inyan Kara Group is
absent as well as covered by alluvial deposits
(inkrsurf). Also, surficial hydrogeology in the Black Hills
study area (hydrogeo).

      <procstep>
        <procdesc>Geologic outcrop areas, absent areas, and overlying alluvial
deposits for the Inyan Kara Group were plotted on a mylar
sheet at 1:100,000 scale. Outcrop areas for the Inyan Kara
Group were reselected from the data set of surficial
hydrogeology ("hydrogeo"). Absent areas and overlying
surficial deposits were taken from the data set
("inkrsurf"). For areas outside of the outcrop, information
from wells was used to interpret the altitude of the top of
the formation and draw contours. Contours were not drawn in
areas where the formation outcrops, is absent, or is
directly overlain by alluvial deposits. Well information is
contained in the data set "inkrswpt".

The mylar-based contours then were digitized. Line topology
was created using the Arc/Info BUILD command. Pseudo nodes
were removed using the UNSPLIT NONE command in Arcedit. Some
arcs became jagged after the UNSPLIT. These arcs were
smoothed interactively in Arcedit. The coverage then was
rebuilt. Attribute items were added to the coverage arc
attribute table.

The attribute item INTERP was used to indicate where lines
were to be dashed on the map of geologic structure
contours. Dashed lines, represented by an INTERP value of
'Y', indicate that geologic structure was "interpreted" in
the area, and was not known through geologic well
logs. Other line segments, where there was confidence in
geologic structure, were assigned a value of 'N' for the
INTERP attribute item, indicating that structure for these
contours was not interpreted. These non-interpreted lines
were drawn as solid lines on the map.

An automated method was used to assign values to the
attribute item INTERP. First, contour lines were overlayed
with a coverage of outcrop geology for the Inyan Kara
Group.

Wells with information from geologic logs were used to
interpret geologic structure. Wells with information for the
Inyan Kara Group were buffered at 1000 meters, creating
polygons of singular and in some cases overlapping, well
buffers. Countour lines within the the well buffers were
assigned a value of 'N' to INTERP, as was done for the
geologic outcrops. Contour lines assigned values to INTERP
using geologic outcrops were not changed.

Arc: BUFFER INKR_WELLS INKR_BUF1K # # 1000 # POINT
Arc: IDENTITY INKR_COUT INKR_BUF1K INKR_COUTB LINE # JOIN

In Tables:

Enter command: SEL INKR_COUTB.AAT
Enter command: RES INTERP CN 'Y' AND INKR_BUF1K# NE 1
Enter command: MOVE 'N' TO INTERP
Enter command: Q STOP

In some instances where contour lines were close to a
well, the above method assigned values of 'N' to INTERP
where they should be 'Y'. Arcedit was used to change values
of INTERP for these lines back to 'Y', so that they would
appear dashed on the map (geologic structure interpreted).

Attribute items that were joined to the arc attribute table
and were associated with the IDENTITY outcrop and well
buffer coverages were dropped.
