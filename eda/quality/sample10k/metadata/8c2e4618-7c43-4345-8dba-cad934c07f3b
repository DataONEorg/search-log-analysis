      <abstract>As part of the U.S. Geological Survey's National Water-Quality Assessment
Program, an investigation of the Yellowstone River Basin study unit is
being conducted to document status and trends in surface- and ground-water
quality.  Surface-water samples are collected from streams (or lakes) at
specific sampling stations.  Water-quality characteristics at each station are
influenced by the natural and cultural characteristics of the drainage area
upstream from the sampling station.  Efficient quantification of the drainage
area characteristics requires a digital map of the drainage area boundary that
may be processed, together with other digital thematic maps (such as geology
or land use), in a geographic information system (GIS).  Digital drainage-area
data for 24 selected stream-sampling stations in the Yellowstone River Basin
are included in this data release.  The drainage divides were identified
chiefly using 1:100,000-scale (50 m accuracy) hypsography. Drainage areas
based on 1:100,000-scale hypsography data generally agree to within 5 percent
with drainage areas measured at 1:24,000 scale, for areas larger than 50 km2.

      <purpose>The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) began full implementation of the National
Water-Quality Assessment (NAWQA) program in 1991. The program objectives are
to describe current water-quality conditions and trends over time; and to
improve our understanding of the natural and human factors that affect water
quality. The Yellowstone River Basin (YRB) is one of more than 50 areas to be
studied for this program.
		
Among the principal program activities, water, bed-sediment, and tissue
samples are collected from streams (or lakes) at specific sampling stations
and analyzed for a large suite of chemical and physical constituents.
Water-quality characteristics at each station are influenced by the natural
and cultural characteristics of the drainage area upstream from the sampling
station.  Efficient quantification of drainage area characteristics requires a
digital map of the drainage area boundary that may be processed, together with
other digital thematic maps (such as geology or land use), in a geographic
information system (GIS).
		
For NAWQA, sampling stations typically have drainage areas ranging from 50 to
500 km2 (indicator sites) or are located downstream of large river basins.
Drainage areas based on 1:100,000-scale hypsography data generally agree to
within 5 percent with drainage areas measured at 1:24,000 scale, for areas
larger than 50 km2.  Therefore, the digital drainage-area data for 24 selected
stream-sampling stations in the Yellowstone River Basin were based chiefly
on 1:100,000-scale (50 m accuracy) hypsography.
			</purpose>
      <supplinf>For the Montana part of the YRB study unit, an existing source of digital
drainage area boundaries was available at a nominal scale of 1:100,000.  The
U.S. Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service had
delineated hydrologic unit boundaries at their Watershed (11-digit) level.
The digital data were converted to Arc/Info vector format by the Montana State
Library.

Existing watershed boundaries often do not correspond exactly with the
drainage area for a sampling station because watersheds typically begin at
stream confluences, whereas sampling stations typically are located upstream
from confluences.  Digital raster graphic (DRG) images of USGS topographic
quadrangles recently became available at nominal scales of 1:24,000 and
1:100,000.  These georeferenced images contain the necessary hypsographic
information to guide the delineation and digitization of drainage area
boundaries.  Where modifications or additions to existing watershed boundaries
were needed, DRG images were used as the base for new drainage divide data.
		
For the Wyoming part of the YRB study unit, no existing source of digital
drainage area boundaries was identified at a scale larger than 1:250,000.
However, hypsographic digital data at 1:100,000 scale were available statewide
from the USGS Geodata web server.  Those data are in digital line graph (DLG)
format, which is readily converted to Arc/Info vector format.  The eight DLG
files of hypsography data that compose each USGS 30- by 60-minute quadrangle
were processed in a standardized fashion to produce a single Arc/Info-format
hypsography data set per quadrangle.  Delineation and digitization of
drainage divides for Wyoming was based on the digital hypsography data.
		
Final steps in the data set production included the assembly of polygons,
addition of polygon label points (coded as to station number), and checks
for various types of errors.  Additional details are presented in the Data
Quality section of the metadata.
		
Any use of trade, product, or firm names is for descriptive
purposes only and does not imply endorsement by the U.S. Government.
		
Although this Federal Geographic Data Committee-compliant metadata
file is intended to document the data set in nonproprietary form, as
well as in ARC/INFO format, this metadata file may include some
ARC/INFO-specific terminology.

When aggregated by station drainage area, the digitized areas for the
18 stations that had pre-existing records in the NWIS site file had a
mean absolute deviation of 2.1 percent (and median of 0.7 percent) from
the NWIS drainage area value.  However, excluding the drainage area for
Clarks Fork Yellowstone River at Edgar, Mont. (for which the NWIS record
appears questionable), the mean absolute deviation for the remaining 17
stations was 1.6 percent (and median of 0.5 percent) of the NWIS total
drainage area.  The comparative data are listed in the table below.

      <horizpa>
        <horizpar>The absolute horizontal accuracy, that is, actual difference in position
between the physical drainage-area boundaries and the corresponding
digital locations given in this data set, is unknown.
		
The relative horizontal accuracy is source-dependent and is based on the
1:100,000-scale USGS topographic series map.  The approximate horizontal
accuracy of the 1:100,000-scale source data is 51 meters, assuming that
the source materials meet National Map Accuracy Standards, as reported.
However, the accuracy of the watershed boundaries in relation to the
1:100,000-scale topographic contour data appears to be slightly less
accurate, and is considered to be positionally correct to within 80 meters
wherever contour data exist in the source materials.  Technical reviewers
of the data set examined about 8 percent of the line segments (including at
least one segment from each data source).  The reviewers found
only one segment (about 300 meters in length) that deviated by more than
80 meters from the alignment they considered to be correct (based on the
1:100,000-scale topographic contour data).  That short segment was corrected,
but one can logically deduce that the remaining 92 percent of line segments
that were not inspected may contain a similar proportion of errors.
		
Technical reviewers also detected needed changes to linework where the
location of the USGS sampling station had been updated, causing a shift
in position of the downstream end of the drainage area.  The needed changes
to the digital boundaries were made, but the implication remains that any
remaining errors in sampling station positions, or subsequent relocations
of sampling stations, will cause corresponding errors in the digital
drainage-area boundaries.
		
The digital map elements were edge matched against the data for
the adjacent quadrangle.  Edge match locations generally do not
deviate from centerline to centerline by more than 51 meters
(0.02 in.).  One connector segment was added where edge match
locations deviated by more than 51 meters.

        <procdesc>Following technical review, interactive editing was used to make corrections
to several line features, particularly at the downstream ends of drainage
areas where sampling station locations had been updated or corrected
subsequent to initial creation of the data set in 1998.  Several label points
then had to be repositioned to place them back into the correct polygon.
Two "dangling arcs" were deleted.  Original linework (that is, not copied from
another source) was processed with "UNSPLIT" to reduce the number of line
segments and nodes in the data set.
Also, station number 425440109152501 was changed to 435440109152501, to
reflect the change made to the NWIS record.
Updated topology and checked attribute tables.

ONE_STAID - logical flag for sampling stations whose drainage area is
composed of a single polygon.  Encoded as:
&gt;   Y = single-polygon drainage area.
&gt;   N = multiple-polygon drainage area.
		
The use of this look-up table is illustrated by the following simple example,
performed using the TABLES module of Arc/Info:
		
&gt; Enter Command: asel
&gt; 24 Records Selected.
&gt;
&gt; Enter Command: res BIGKANE = 'Y'
&gt; 3 Records Selected.
&gt;
&gt; Enter Command: li STAID,STANAME
&gt; Record  STAID           STANAME
&gt;      6  06279500        Bighorn R at Kane WY
&gt;     19  425440109152501 Wood R bl Galena Cr WY
&gt;     20  435602109095301 Wood R ab Mid Fk Wood R WY
		
Through establishing a data base relate (using STAID as the relational key),
a similar procedure can be used to select the set of polygons that compose
the complete drainage area for an individual sampling station.
