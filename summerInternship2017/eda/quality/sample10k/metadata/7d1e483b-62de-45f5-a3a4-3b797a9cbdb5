      <abstract>Between 2006 and 2011 Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC), under contract by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) National Ocean Service (NOS), collected twenty-three hydrographic surveys totaling over 4100 square-kilometers of Reson multibeam bathymetric and Klein sidescan-sonar data for the purposes of updating nautical charts. Data extended from the entrance of Delaware Bay south to Parramore Island in water depths from about 3 to 35 meters below mean lower low water. Data were collected at a fixed 40-meter line spacing which provided 40-100 percent seafloor coverage for multibeam bathymetry. NOS releases processed bathymetry via an interactive map interface in bathymetry attributed grid (BAG) format. All twenty-three survey datasets were downloaded, merged, resampled, and interpolated to fill data gaps. Sidescan data products are limited within the Delmarva survey area and there are no multibeam backscatter data products available. The U.S. Geological Survey obtained the raw RESON multibeam data files from SAIC and NOAA for twenty of the hydrographic surveys and extracted the backscatter data using Quality Positioning Service's (QPS) Fledermaus FMGeocoder Toolbox (FMGT) to produce backscatter mosaics for the inner-continental shelf of the Delmarva Peninsula. Backscatter mosaics and regional seamless bathymetric datasets created from NOAA data are a valuable tool for characterizing seafloor geology, sediment transport pathways, and marine resources. Additionally, obtaining this near full seafloor coverage backscatter and bathymetry dataset from an existing source greatly increased project deliverables, geophysical survey efficiency, collaboration among government agencies, and the area over which geologic data interpretations can be conducted by the USGS.</abstract>
      <purpose>These 20 2-m interpolated backscatter surfaces were created from NOAA-NOS hydrographic survey datasets. Backscatter mosaic images are useful geophysical datasets for geologic framework studies. USGS extracted these backscatter data from NOAA surveys and created seamless mosaics to use in a geologic framework investigation.</purpose>

    <logic>These backscatter mosaic images were created from 20 NOAA-NOS multibeam echosounder (MBES) datasets. NOAA/NOS publishes the bathymetry data in .bag format through NGDC Interactive Map Interface to NOS Data and Products  &lt;http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/bathymetry/hydro.html&gt;. However, MBES backscatter data are not published and even sidescan sonar datasets are limited within this area (only 9 of 23 sidescan H-survey datasets are published through NGDC). In order to create a seamless backscatter mosaic, 20 of the 23 MBES surveys were obtained in their semi-raw form (.gsf format) and were processed to extract backscatter using Quality Positioning Services (QPS) Fledermaus FMGeocoder Toolbox (FMGT) software . All individual mosaics follow the same color convention: Low-backscatter is represented by dark tones (low values) and high-backscatter is represented by bright tones (high values). A DN value of 200 is not necessarily equal among surveys. The file naming convention of the TIFF images follows the Hydrograpic Survey number assigned by NOAA and SAIC.</logic>
    <complete>These images include Reson 8101 and 7125 MBES backscatter collected during 20 M/V Atlantic Surveyor cruises conducted by SAIC for the purposes of updating NOAA nautical charts. The individual hydrographic survey grids can be downloaded by visiting NGDC's Interactive Map Interface to NOS Data and Products: &lt;http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/bathymetry/hydro.html&gt;
There are 23 H-surveys in the bathymetric grid, but only 20 H-surveys could be obtained in .gsf format for backscatter extraction. NOAA was not able to provide .gsf format MBES data for H-surveys H11554, H11555, and H11650.</complete>
    <posacc>
      <horizpa>
        <horizpar>Data collected under contract with NOAA for Nautical Charting must conform to IHO (International Hydrographic Organization) S-44 standards, which is 5-meters + 5% of water depth, horizontally in areas where under-keel clearance is of concern. This ensures that any sounding that falls outside of the maximum allowable horizontal position offset will not be used in depth calculations. Positioning confidence checks are performed daily during hydrographic surveys for NOAA and these checks can be viewed for the individual descriptive reports (see the source data for links to reports). Because MBES backscatter is co-located with the MBES bathymetry, the horizontal accuracies are the same.</horizpar>

        <procdesc>Semi-raw MBES data were obtained from NGDC by request through the NOS Hydrographic data manager, (LTJG David Rodziewicz, NOAA Corps) and through Rebecca T. Quintal of Leidos (formerly SAIC). Semi-raw means that the data have some offsets and corrections applied (i.e. tides, atitude, and positioning), but the data are still in the native Reson acquisition format. NOAA and SAIC were able to supply .gsf format files for 20 of the 23 H-surveys requested. Quality Positioning Services (QPS) Fledermaus FMGeocoder Toolbox (FMGT) software (version 7.4.1) was used to import the semi-raw MBES data and extract the backscatter.
This process step and all of the following process steps were completed by the following Process Contact:</procdesc>

      <procstep>
        <procdesc>The 20 hydrographic surveys were processed individually in FMGT to allow modification of processing parameters among surveys (i.e. modification of ocean absorption coefficients). All the MBES backscatter data were processed as uncalibrated, beam-averaged, logarithmic space (dB) data in either Reson 8101 or 7125 MBES data. Ocean absorption coefficients were not modified for the Reson 8101 data, but the Reson 7125 data were processed with ocean absorption coefficients between 70 and 120, based on information in a technical note published by QPS Fledermaus FMGT developers (https://confluence.qps.nl/display/KBE/Technical+Note+3%3A+Absorption+coefficient). The best ocean absorption coefficient was arrived at by testing a few lines at a time and estimating water temperature, salinity, and sonar frequency.</procdesc>
        <procdate>20140826</procdate>
      </procstep>
      <procstep>
        <procdesc>After data were imported to FMGT, the backscatter was processed based on the user defined inputs described in the previous step and a mosaic was made for the entire survey by defining a mosaic resolution (2-m for all 20 surveys) and bounding extents (based on the survey tracklines).
The processing steps of FMGT are not complex and user-input is limited, but the computational time for processing a single survey from import to processing to mosaic can take up to 24 hours to complete on a 64-bit computer with 4 processers and 12.0 GB of RAM.</procdesc>
        <procdate>20140831</procdate>
      </procstep>
      <procstep>
        <procdesc>After satisfactory mosaic images for each survey were produced with FMGT, survey mosaics were exported as 2-m per pixel GeoTIFF images. The native horizontal coordinate system was GCS, NAD83, so the GeoTIFFs were reprojected in ArcMap (version 10.2) using the NAD83_to_WGS84_5 transformation from GCS to UTM Zone 18N. A .tfw was also created for each GeoTIFF in ArcMAP</procdesc>
        <procdate>20140831</procdate>
      </procstep>
      <procstep>
        <procdesc>Because the data were collected at a set-line spacing of 40-m, some gaps between adjacent lines existed in areas shallower than ~ 10-meters. Matlab (R2014a) was used to fill null values (gaps between adjacent lines and small data drop outs in backscatter) in the GeoTIFFS by interpolating backscatter values from surrounding pixels (f(x) inpaintNaNs). Surveys with an average depth greater than 10-m did not require much interpolation. The background of each image was given a value of 253, so that the background would not be interpolated. The edges of the backscatter mosaic were trimmed in Photoshop (version CS6) to remove interpolation artifacts and trackline dangles.</procdesc>
        <procdate>20140831</procdate>
      </procstep>
      <procstep>
        <procdesc>Edits to the metadata were made to fix any errors that MP v 2.9.30 flagged. This is necessary to enable the metadata to be successfully harvested for various data catalogs. In some cases, this meant adding text "Information unavailable" or "Information unavailable from original metadata" for those required fields that were left blank. Fix publication dates that were ranges and removed empty elements that were unnecesary for the dataset. The links to download the data had to be fixed. The metadata date (but not the metadata creator) was edited to reflect the date of these changes. The metadata available from a harvester may supersede metadata bundled within a download file. Compare the metadata dates to determine which metadata file is most recent.</procdesc>

      <eaover>There are no attributes associated with a GeoTIFF image. Image pixel values contain acoustic reflectivity values normalized to an 8-bit data range. Low-backscatter is represented by dark tones (low values) and high-backscatter is represented by bright tones (high values). The background color is set to 2 and can be turned off without removing data values.</eaover>
