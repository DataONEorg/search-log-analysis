      <abstract>In recent years, attempts have been made to develop numerical models for unsteady flows in channels with sediment transport. This work was conducted to analyze two essential ingredients of any numerical model: the relationship between the hydraulic variables (slope, depth, and velocity), and the predictor of sediment concentration. Report KH-R-43A (not in this archive) presents a detailed analysis of the two components and examines their role in numerical modeling. Six hydraulic relationships and 13 sediment concentration predictors are examined and compared. New relationships are then developed which appear to be more accurate than the existing techniques. Finally, the new relationships are utilized in a numerical unsteady flow, moveable bed model which uses a four-point implicit finite difference solution scheme.

The data base associated with this report (presented originally as Report KH-R-43B) contains 7,027 records (5,263 laboratory records and 1,764 field records), in 77 data files. The data are provided here as two spreadsheets â€“ field data and laboratory data.

Not all records were used in the final analyses, but they have been included in an attempt to provide a historically complete set of alluvial channel observations. The material presented in these reports is essentially the same as the thesis submitted by the author in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy. A common list of references, with data sources separated from other references, has been included in both reports. 

Abstract:

A compilation of twentieth century observations of alluvial channels, both field and lab, in a standard format, from a wide variety of sources. Source: Compilation of Alluvial Channel Data: Laboratory and Field, by William R. Brownlie, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, November 1981 Data are arranged by stream, and include measuremens of discharge, width, length, depth, slope, temperature, and bedload measures including D50 grainsize, gradation, specific gravity, and concentration.</abstract>
