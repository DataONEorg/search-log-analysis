<abstract>
<para>Weekly relative snail abundance samples were collected in five sites located in three villages covering the main climatic zones of the country from May 2014 to October 2015. Automatic monitoring stations were installed in all sites to measure relevant environmental variables. The purpose of the data was to study the seasonal fluctuations of the abundance of freshwater snails acting as intermediate hosts of schistosomiasis in Bukrina Faso.</para>

<title>Ecological and environmental sampling of snail abundance and relevant covariates</title>
<para>The ecological sampling method consisted in time-based snail abundance counts in 4 habitats across Burkina Faso. The number of collected snails and sampling metadata were recorded in dedicated sampling sheets. Also, Bulinus spp. or Biomphalaria spp. specimen were stored in dated urine collection cups in a mixture of clear well water and (90&#37;) alcohol. Sampling was undertaken by trained field technicians. Training was given during one week before the start of the campaign, and feedback was given by bi-weekly phone calls and regular on-site visits during the whole sampling campaign. Biological samples were sent every 3 months back to the Microbiology and Biotechnology Laboratory of the Institut International d'IngÃ©nierie de l'Eau et de l'Environnement (2iE) in Ouagadougou for recounting and species identification using standard identification keys. </para>
<para>The environmental sampling method was based on the continuous monitoring of the environmental parameters of the snail habitats followed in which snail abundance was sampled. A total of 15 Sensorscpe (http://www.sensorscope.ch/) stations with three sensors each was deployed in the three sites, starting May 2014 in Tougou, June 2014 in Panamasso and July 2014 in Lioulgou. Measurements were taken every 30 seconds and data were sent to a central server using the mobile phone network. Data were accessible online through a dedicated web portal (http://climaps.com). Measured variables include air temperature, precipitation, water level, conductivity and temperature. Additional temperature data loggers were placed in the temporary pond in Lioulgou because it was not covered by the wireless stations.

<para>Three villages were retained along the transition from the Sudanian to Sahelian climatic zones. The choice of these experimental sites accounted for the spatially varying climatic conditions in Burkina Faso, the habitat preferences of the snail intermediate hosts, previously studied habitats, and logistic constraints (site accessibility, travel time, total available budget). Panamasso (11deg 23min 23.4sec N, 4deg 12min 02.5sec W) is a village adjacent to a small perennial stream in the South-Western part of the country. Lioulgou (12deg 00min 38.8sec N, 0deg 21min 48.2sec W) is situated in the central part of the country in a low-land subject to flooding during the wet season and dry the rest of the year. Finally Tougou (13deg 41min 06.0sec N, 2deg 14min 22.2sec W) is located in the Northern sahelian climate next to a small reservoir that feeds an irrigation network year round. The sampling locations within the retained villages covered the most common habitats for species of both intermediate hosts. In total four sampling locations were retained in the three experimental sites, one on the perennial stream in Panamasso, two in Lioulgou in the ephemeral river draining the low-land and in a temporary pond, and one in Tougou in an irrigation canal. The irrigation canal was dry from April to June, and intense rainfall events flooded the canal and the surrounding rice fields in August, which made the area inaccessible during 2 weeks. Because of these exceptional environmental conditions the analysis of the snail dynamics in the canal focuses on the period up to March 2015.</para>

<para>The ecological sampling protocol consisted of systemically scooping the investigated habitat for 30 minutes using a 2mm metal mesh (Hairston Bull. World Health Org., 1958). </para>
