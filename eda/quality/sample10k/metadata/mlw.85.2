  <abstract><para>With the characteristics of insect-borne transmission and systemic infection, Paulownia witches&#8217;-broom (PaWB) disease has been considered a serious epidemic disease in Taiwan. PaWB phytoplasma (PaWBP) weakens paulownia plants seriously, and has an enormous influence on paulownia cultivation. To diagnose PaWB accurately, a rapid and reliable detection method, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based analysis using primers derived from PaWBP 16S rDNA sequences, was established previously. We used PCR-assay to trace the incubation periods of PaWBP, symptom expression stages of infected paulownia, distribution and concentration of PaWBP in paulownia trees and insect vectors. The incubation period of the PaWBP-infected paulownia (10 cm height) was about 3 mo; distributions of PaWBP plants in mesophyll, petiole, vein and bark of paulownia were from high to low respectively by PCR-assay. We also found that it took about 3 mo for PaWBP to move from the top grafting site to the basal root in 30 cm height paulownia plants. In this study, it was proved that Halyomorpha mista could successfully transmit PaWBP from diseased paulownia to healthy paulownia seedlings, and detection of PaWBP in H. mista was confirmed by PCR as well. Field tracking showed 2 population peaks of H. mista during the year, March to April and August to October. These results may be helpful in insect vector control in the future. In resistance experiments, paulownia hybrids also showed higher resistance than purebreds.</para>

 <para>PaWBP-infected paulownia (Paulownia taiwaniana) tissues with characteristic symptoms of PaWB were collected from the Lienhwachih Branch of the Taiwan Forestry Research Institute and used in this study. Twenty one paulownia hybrids and 3 purebreds (Table 1) were used. These experimental hybrids were obtained from pathogen-free seedlings through shoot-tip grafting techniques (Murashige et al. 1972) and kept in an insect-proof greenhouse. PaWBP-infected paulownia buds were side-grafted on healthy paulownia plants as inoculum sources. Healthy paulownia seeedlings were aseptically germinated in a growth chamber and used as negative controls. The monitoring of PaWBP was conducted by PCR-assay with PaWBP-specific primers and symptoms expression records.</para>

 <methodStep><description><section><title>Specific primers for PaWBP</title>
 <para>Two opposing primers for PCR-based detection of PaWBP were chosen from the sequence of cloned PaWBP-specific DNA fragments (Wu et al. 2002). The primer pair, composed of the forward primer 5&#8217;-TCC ATG TCT CTT TCA ATT CCT-3&#8217; and the reverse primer 5&#8217;-AAA AGC TAT TCA AAA TTA TGC C-3&#8217;, were designed to amplify a PaWBP-specific DNA fragment by PCR.</para>

 <methodStep><description><section><title>Preparations of DNA samples for PCR</title>
 <para>For rapid mass-screening, minipreparations of total nucleic acid extracts of PaWBP-infected samples were used as templates for PCR. Nucleic acid samples were prepared using a method described by Lee and Davis (1988), Lee et al. (1988), and Lee et al. (1990) with minor modification. Mesophyll (ca. 500 mg) was powdered in liquid nitrogen, and each sample was suspended in 1.5 mL of DNA extraction buffer (0.1 M Tris-HCl [pH 8.0], 0.05 M EDTA, 0.5 M NaCl, 1% N-lauroylsarcosine), and transferred to a 1.5-mL eppendorf tube. After incubation at 55&#8451; for 1 h, the sample was centrifuged at 4000 x g for 5 min. After the supernatant (ca. 800 &#956;L) was collected, 100 &#956;L of 5 M NaCl and 100&#956;L of 10% CTAB (hexadecyl-trimethyl-ammonium-bromide) in 0.7 M NaCl were added, and the mixture was incubated at 65&#8451;for 10 min. The sample was subjected to 1 cycle of chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (24: 1) extraction, and the aqueous supernatant was then re-extracted with an additional cycle of phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25: 24: 1). The nucleic acids were precipitated by mixing 600 &#956;L of the supernatant and 360 &#956;L of isopropanol followed by centrifugation at 12,000 x g for 10 min. The pellets were washed with 70% ethanol, dried, and resuspended in 150 &#956;L TE buffer.</para>

 <methodStep><description><section><title>PCR conditions</title>
 <para>PCR was performed using 25 &#956;L of reaction mixture containing 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.4), 50 mM KCl, 4 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM each of dATP, dTTP, dCTP, and dGTP, 10 pmole forward primer, 10 pmole reverse primer, 0.75 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Gibco BRL), and 200 ng of template from the nucleic acid preparation. The thermal cycle conditions were: 1 cycle at 94&#8451; for 3 min; 30 cycles at 94&#8451; for 1 min, 54&#8451; for 1 min, and 72&#8451; for 2 min, followed by a 72&#8451; extension for 10 min. Reactions were carried out in a DNA Thermal Cycler 9600.</para>

 <methodStep><description><section><title>Analysis of PCR products by electrophoresis</title>
 <para>PCR products were identified by gel electrophoresis using 1.5% agarose (Boehringer Mannheim) in TAE buffer (40 mM Tris-acetate [pH 8.0], 1 mM EDTA). After electrophoresis, the gel was stained with ethidium bromide (0.5 &#956;g/mL) and photographed. The 100-bp DNA ladder set (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) was included as size markers. The electrophoresis was run for 30~40 min at high voltage (100 V).</para>

 <para>PaWBP-free bugs (H. mista) were initiated from single females collected from PaWBP-free paulownia (P. taiwaniana) plants. These bugs were added on caged pods of PaWBP-free paulownia plants at 25~28&#8451;, under a 16-h light and 8-h dark cycle. After starvation for 30 min, the adults were put in a Petri dish for a 24-hr acquisition feeding period of paulownia infected with PaWBP. These viruliferous adults were transferred to healthy paulownia (P. taiwaniana) seedlings for a 24-hr inoculation access period and then eliminated with insecticide. Inoculated paulownia plants were cultivated at 25~28&#8451;. The transmission was determined according to the results of PCR analysis and symptom development.</para>
 <para>For the study of bug-transmission, adult bugs were moved to a PaWBP-infected paulownia plant for a 24-hr acquisition access period (AAP). These viruliferous adults was then collected and divided into 5 groups including single, 5, 10, 20, 50 adults, respectively. The PaWBP-free paulownia plants (1-month-old, 10 cm-tall) were individually inoculated with single, 5, 10, 20, 50 viruliferous adults for inoculation access period (IAP).</para>
