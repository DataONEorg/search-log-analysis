      <abstract>The obtop_f grid represents the modeled elevation of the top of the Overburden geomodel unit at a 500 foot resolution. It is one grid of a geomodel that consists of eleven grids and a spatial extent polygon shapefile.  As part of a U.S. Geological Survey Groundwater Resources Program study, a three-dimensional geomodel was constructed for approximately 53,000 mi2 of the Columbia Plateau in Washington, Oregon, and Idaho. This geomodel was constructed to define the general aquifer system geometry for use in a regional numerical groundwater flow model. Simplifications and assumptions consistent with this ultimate goal and the uncertainty in the available data were made. The geomodel units consist of Miocene age Columbia River Basalt Group strata and younger alluvial overburden covering approximately 44,000 mi2. Data were compiled from numerous databases and detailed studies completed during the past three decades. These data include stratigraphic interpretations made on more than 13,000 wells and a contiguous compilation of surficial geology and structural features spanning the study area. These data were simplified and used to construct piecewise-smooth trend surfaces that represent upper and lower subsurface geomodel unit boundaries in this complex folded and faulted terrain.  The smoothness of the surfaces implicitly represents uncertainty in prediction of each surface resulting from data gaps, errors in borehole interpretations, errors in mapped contact locations, and uncertainty in the shape of the paleo-surface upon which flood basalts were emplaced. Using a rule-based algorithm, surfaces were then recombined to construct a fully three-dimensional model with a 500-foot grid resolution that is consistent with the data and for which error estimates may be made. The modeling process yielded improved estimates of unit volumes, refinement of location of large structural features, and identification of features that may be important for ongoing groundwater studies.</abstract>
      <purpose>The obtop_f grid represents the modeled elevation of the top of the Overburden geomodel unit and was generated as part of a geomodel that will be used as the foundation for a groundwater flow model for the Columbia Plateau Regional Aquifer System. This study is part of the Groundwater Resources Program funded by the USGS Office of Groundwater.

      <attraccr>The resulting geomodel integrates a large number of different types of data to create a fully-consistent three-dimensional representation of the large-scale geometry of the Columbia Plateau Regional Aquifer System. As such, it is the synthesis of the best current understanding gained from previous studies at a variety of scales. Its error is quantifiable (fig. 11a-d in report), with the error being a function of the amount of data. The following list of shortcomings should be considered when using the results of this study:
There are errors in the data used to construct the surfaces. This is known because some studies did not agree on stratigraphic interpretations. These errors may cause bias in the interpreted surfaces. Many of the picks made for particular units are inferential, based on previous work, which may be the source of some errors.

In most cases, the data are not closely enough spaced to resolve features below the scale of the trend model.
Generally, error increases with depth due to limited amounts of data in many areas. This is evidenced in the residual histograms (fig. 11 a-d in report). The Older Bedrock Unit top has some bias, and may be underestimated in the north and northwest where Columbia River Basalt Group depositional style has changed from flood basalt to intra-canyon flows.  
Error increases with distance from data. The error implied by the residual histograms may be misleading very far from data since the implicit assumption is that the trend surface is correct on average.
Error in heavily folded or faulted areas is greater than for smoothly varying areas with moderate data support. Our dataset was insufficient to resolve these features.
The surfaces and thickness are modeled from smooth trend surfaces representing unit tops and consequently result in smooth tops where buried. The modeled values represent expected values at any subsurface location, but the true value will likely be somewhat different. Confidence that a unit will be encountered within a given range of elevations may be computed from the residuals.</attraccr>

        <procdesc>The obtop_f grid was generated by estimating the thickness of sediments at all locations within the study area, subtracting it from the land surface digital elevation model (DEM), and then intersecting the resulting surface with a trend surface of the top of alluvium in lowlands (local valleys). The DEM is a 500-foot grid that was resampled from a 30-meter National Elevation Dataset (NED) DEM. If the difference in surfaces is negative, it is assumed the geology is dominated by bedrock outcrops, and a value of NULL was entered to indicate significant sedimentary thickness is not present. If it was positive, an appreciably thick sequence of alluvium is assumed to exist, and the value of the DEM was entered, indicating the assigned value represents the elevation in feet of the Overburden unit top at that location. This is one of five modeled surfaces. The modeled geologic unit tops, listed in order from uppermost to lowermost, are (1) obtop_f (modeled top of the Overburden unit), (2) smtop_f (modeled top of the Saddle Mountains Basalt unit), (3) wntop_f (modeled top of the Wanapum Basalt unit), (4) grtop_f (modeled top of the Grande Ronde Basalt unit), and (5) pmtop_f (modeled top of the Older Bedrock unit).
