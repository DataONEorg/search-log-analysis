      <abstract>
        U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's River Reach File 1 (RF1)to
        ensure the hydrologic integrity of the digital reach traces and
        to quantify the mean water time of travel in river reaches and reservoirs
        [see USEPA (1996) for a description of the original RF1].
			</abstract>
      <purpose>
        reaches capable of supporting regional and national water-quality and
        river-flow modeling and transport investigations in the
        water-resources community.
        ERF1 has been recently used at the U.S.
        Geological Survey to support interpretations of stream water-quality
        monitoring network data (see Alexander and others, 1996; Smith and
        others, 1995).  In these analyses, the reach network has been used to
        determine flow pathways between the sources of point and nonpoint
        pollutants (e.g., fertilizer use, municipal wastewater discharges) and
        downstream water-quality monitoring locations in support of
        predictive water-quality models of stream nutrient transport.

      The version of RF1 used to compile ERF1 was an early edition of a USGS
      RF1 translation and was recently updated by USEPA (1996).  The capability
      of the enhanced version of RF1 (ERF1) and the current USEPA version has
      not been evaluated.  The user is referred to the USEPA version
      [see Web address given in the USEPA (1996) reference] for discussions
      of streamflow accuracy and general background on the origin of RF1.

        The direct drainage area of each reach (RCHAREA) was computed by
        Smith and others (1997) using a Theissen method.  It considers solely
        the distance to the nearest reach and does not consider any
        topographic features. It provides reasonably good estimates for
        higher-order streams, but is less accurate for lower orders.
        See process steps 3, 4, and 5, to assess the accuracy of MEANV,
        RCHTOT, and RESTOT.

    <logic>
      This data set is believed to provide complete and accurate
      connectivity among the streams represented. These arcs representing
      streams are intended to be presented in a TNODE to FNODE
      orientation. The arcs are pointing in a downstream direction.
		</logic>
    <complete>
      The set of streams represented reflects the choices in the
      U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's "Reach File 1." See
      DeWald and others, 1985.

          Reservoir and lake boundaries were removed from the original RF1
          data set. They are represented by a single trace to satisfy
          the connectivity requirements of the dataset.  ArcEdit functions
          were used to delineate centerlines within the RF1 shoreline
          boundaries.  The centerline reaches approximate the thalweg of each
          reservoir or lake.
          Shorlines of major estuaries and some coastal areas were added
          to the data set to serve as a stopping location for trace
          routines. Existing reaches extending within estuaries were deleted.

          (a) The RF1 trace file was edited to exclude reservoir shorelines.
          Segments with a TYPE='L' (lake shoreline segment) were removed from
          the file.
          (b) ArcEdit functions were used to create centerlines within the RF1
          shoreline boundaries.  A separate coverage of the shoreline segments
          was superpositioned as a backcover in ArcEdit and used as a guide in
          the manual positioning of the centerlines.  The downstream nodes of
          tributary reaches were moved (using the VERTEX MOVE ArcEdit command)
          and joined with other tributary nodes to form centerlines. The
          VERTEX ADD ArcEdit function was applied to centerline reaches in
          ArcEdit to ensure that the new arcs approximated the thalweg of each
          reservoir.
          A total of 4,180 reaches in 1,146 reservoirs were added as
          centerlines to produce a total of 60,298 reaches in ERF1 trace file.
          [Note that in one case the interior reach extends beyond the
          reservoir boundaries (ERF1##=10117).  In future editions of the
          file, a node will be added at the reservoir outlet.  Also note that
          the attributes listed in the ERF1.AAT file may not be accurate for
          centerlines because these reaches were created from reservoir
          tributary reaches.]

          Using the ArcPlot TRACE function, the connectivity of reaches was
          determined by navigating upstream from all reaches where there
          is no downstream reach. These reaches are called terminal reaches.
          Disruptions in navigation resulting from disconnected nodes or, more
          commonly, improperly oriented arcs were corrected in ArcEdit by
          joining nodes or "flipping" the arc direction, respectively.  To
          conform with TRACE requirements, from-nodes (FNODE#) were located at
          the downstream end of each reach and to-nodes (TNODE#) were located
          at the upstream end of the reaches.  This node orientation is
          maintained in the final version of ERF1.
          Fewer than 10 disruptions were detected in navigation in each of
          water-resources regions.  Additional edits were performed to
          correct a few instances of circular reaches (identical to- and
          from-nodes) and inaccurate digital representations of rivers.

          For approximately 5,600 reaches with missing mean velocity values
          (and positive mean streamflow values), estimates of mean velocity
          were made using the regression-based approach developed by W.E. Gates
          and Associates (USEPA, written communication, Nov 1982, "Reach
          File Enhancements, Chapter 3, Development of time-of-travel
          predictions).  The authors developed regression relations for each
          of 9 stream orders from USGS topographic sheets that were used to
          predict velocity as a function of streamflow and stream order.  The
          calibration data set consisted of 2229 time-of-travel/velocity/
          discharge measurements.  Velocity is related to log-transformed
          flow and flow squared separately for data from each stream order.
          Because of differences in stream order of USGS topographic maps and
          RF1 scale digitizations, a probability matrix was established to
          compute a stream-order weighted estimate of velocity for ERF1.

          The reach time-of-travel (RCHTOT) in units of days was computed as
          the quotient of reach length and reach velocity for 59,364 reaches
          with positive values of velocity such that
                   RCHTOT = C1 * LENGTH / MEANV                    (1)
          where C1 is a conversion factor of 0.00003797 ft-day/meter-second,
          LENGTH is the length in meters of the Arc reach segment, and MEANV
          is the mean velocity in feet per second.  Reaches with missing
          time-of-travel are assigned a value of zero.

          (a) ERF1 centerlines were associated with the RF1
          shoreline features and attributes (i.e., reservoir name in
          PNAME and unique reservoir code in PNMCD) by converting reservoir
          shoreline segments to polygons and intersecting these polygons
          with the centerlines.  A total of 4,180 reaches were linked
          to 1,146 reservoirs with shoreline boundaries in RF1.
          (b) These centerline reaches were digitally matched with
          reservoirs identified in the USGS reservoir file (Ruddy and Hitt,
          1990) by linking each reservoir to the nearest centerline within
          10 kilometers using the Arc NEAR function.  The USGS reservoir
          file consists of 2,728 reservoirs with normal capacity of at least
          5,000 acre-feet or maximum capacities of at least 25,000 acre-feet
          and that were completed as of January 1, 1988.  These reservoirs
          are digitally represented by points in an Arc coverage which represent
          the location of the center of the dam. [see Web location cited in
          references for Ruddy and Hitt (1990)].
          Manual verification of reservoir-RF1 reach links were completed by
          comparing the river and reservoir names in RF1 to those in the
          USGS reservoir file, and by visual inspection for agreement
          between the centerlines and reservoir shoreline boundaries.
          A total of 815 reservoirs were matched with RF1 shorelines
          features (350 unmatched RF1 water bodies).  Of these 815
          reservoirs, there are 19 pairs of reservoirs that match the same
          RF1 water body (i.e., duplicate PNMCD-RES values in the file
          ERF1.RESINT), and 2 RF1 water bodies that match the same USGS
          reservoir RESERVOIR##=1004).  Reservoir residence time (i.e.,
          time-of-travel or RESTOT) in units of days was computed for 810
          reservoirs with available values of normal capacity and outflow
          such that
                 RESTOT = NORMCAP / MEANQ-OUT * C2               (2)
          where NORMCAP is the normal capacity in acre-feet from the USGS
          reservoir file, MEANQ-OUT is the mean streamflow for the immediate
          reach downstream of the reservoir, and C2 is a conversion factor
          of 0.50416 cubic feet-day/acre feet-second.  Reservoirs with
          missing time-of-travel values are assigned a value of zero.
          The reservoir attributes for 1,165 reservoirs appear in the file
          ERF1.RESINT.
          (c) Remaining reservoirs in the USGS reservoir file were initially
          matched to RF1 reaches located outside of the RF1 shoreline
          boundaries using the Arc NEAR criterion of 10 kilometers described
          previously.  Manual verification of links was initially completed
          by comparing the river names with those in the USGS reservoir
          file.
          An automated graphical display using AML was created to allow visual
          verification and correction of the remaining reservoir-reach links
          and previous links that were in question.  USGS topographic maps
          were used in combination with the display aml to obtain accurate
          reservoir-reach matches.
          A total of 1,322 reservoirs were matched to 1,245 RF1 reaches
          external to RF1 shoreline boundaries (RESCODE = 3, 4, or 5).
          Multiple reservoirs were linked to 67 reaches (2 reaches with 4
          reservoirs each; 6 reaches with 3 reservoirs each; and 59 reaches
          with 2 reservoirs each).  Reservoir residence time in units of
          days (RESTOT) was computed for 1,296 reservoirs with available
          values of normal capacity and streamflow such that
                   RESTOT = NORMCAP / MEANQ * C2                  (3)
          where MEANQ is the RF1 reach mean streamflow.
          The reservoir attributes for 1,322 reservoirs appear in the file
          ERF1.RESEXT.

        RESTOT
        &gt; Where RESTOT is a positive value, the reservoir residence time
        &gt; (computed  as quotient of the normal capacity of the reservoir
        &gt; and the streamflow at the outlet of the reservoir) is used to
        &gt; define the water time of travel in the  reach.  Where multiple
        &gt; reaches are associated with a single reservoir, the reach share
        &gt; of the reservoir residence time is proportional to the reach
        &gt; length relative to the total reach length of the reservoir.

        TYPE -- RF1 attribute
        &gt; Reach Type - The term "reach type", not to be confused with any of the
        &gt; Reach File record types, refers to a one-character code assigned to each
        &gt; RF1 reach to categorize transport reaches and shoreline reaches as follows:
        &gt;     A. Artificial Lake Reach (A transport reach). An artificial reach
        &gt;        within a lake or reservoir inserted in the file to provide
        &gt;        connection between input and output reaches of the open water.
        &gt;     B. Bi-directional Reach (A transport reach). A reach for which the
        &gt;        direction of flow is ambiguous.
        &gt;     C. Coastal or Continental Shoreline Segment (A shoreline reach) A
        &gt;        reach which represents a segment of a shoreline of a gulf, sea, or
        &gt;        ocean.
        &gt;     D. Dam Reach (A transport reach). A reach which is a dam through
        &gt;        which and/or around which water flows. This type of reach has the
        &gt;        same primary and open water names as the next reach upstream.
        &gt;     E. Entry Reach (A transport reach). A reach which receives flow
        &gt;        from Canada or Mexico.
        &gt;     F. Falls Reach (A transport reach). A reach which is either a
        &gt;        waterfall, drop spillway, or a reach of rapids.
        &gt;     G. Great Lakes Shoreline Segment (A shoreline reach). A reach which
        &gt;        represents a segment of a shoreline of the the Great Lakes.
        &gt;     I. Island Shoreline Segment (A shoreline reach). A reach which
        &gt;        represents a segment of a shoreline of an island.
        &gt;     L. Lake Shoreline Segment (A shoreline reach). A segment which follows
        &gt;        the shoreline of a lake other than one of the Great Lakes.
        &gt;     M. Artificial Open Water Reach (A transport reach). An artificial
        &gt;        reach within any open water, other than a lake or reservoir, to
        &gt;        provide connection between input and output reaches of the open
        &gt;        water.
        &gt;     N. Non-Connected Reach (A transport reach). A reach not having codes
        &gt;        to link it to other reaches.
        &gt;     R. Regular Reach (A transport reach). A reach which has upstream and
        &gt;        downstream reaches connected to it and which is not classified as
        &gt;        another type of reach.
        &gt;     S. Start Reach (A transport reach). A headwater reach which has no
        &gt;        reaches above it and either one or two transport reaches connected
        &gt;        to its downstream end.
        &gt;     T. Terminal Reach (A transport reach). A reach downstream of which
        &gt;        there is no other reach (for example, a reach which terminates
        &gt;        into an ocean, a land-locked lake, or the ground). This type of
        &gt;        reach has either one or two reaches connected to its upstream end.
        &gt;     V. Open Water Terminal Reach (A transport reach). A reach which is both
        &gt;        a terminal reach and an artificial open water reach.
        &gt;     W. Wide-River Shoreline Segment (A shoreline reach). A reach which
        &gt;        represents a segment of the left or right bank of a stream.
        &gt;     X. Terminal Start Reach (A transport reach). A reach which is both a
        &gt;        terminal reach and a start reach.
        &gt;     Y. International Boundary Reach (A transport reach). A reach extending
        &gt;        along a portion of an international boundary. Occurences of this
        &gt;        type of reach are not actual surface water features. Instead, they
        &gt;        are a type of artificial reach. They have been inserted in the file
        &gt;        for database navigation between reaches along streams which flow
        &gt;        out and then back into the US. They are not intended for usual
        &gt;        studies of streamflow or the fate of pollutants.
        &gt;     Z. Terminal Entry Reach (A transport reach). A reach which is both a
        &gt;        terminal reach and an entry reach.
