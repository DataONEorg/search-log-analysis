            <abstract>Water-surface elevations were recorded by 17 submerged water level loggers between March and October, 2016 along a 3 kilometer reach of the upper Deschutes River, Oregon. 15 water level loggers were installed along the channel margins and 2 loggers were placed in off-channel wetland ponds. Submerged depths recorded at each logger were converted to water surface elevations using real-time kinematic global positioning system (RTK-GPS) measurements of water surface elevation near each water level logger location. Water surface elevation recorded at the loggers captured discharges ranging from approximately 600 to over 2,000 cubic feet/second recorded at the Bureau of Reclamation gage at Benham Falls.</abstract>
            <purpose>The Upper Deschutes River is regulated to provide irrigation water for downstream agriculture. During the winter months (October &#8211; February), streamflow is curtailed at Wickiup Dam and stored in the reservoir resulting in decreased stream flows downstream of Wickiup Dam when compared to historic unregulated flows. Conversely, during summer months (March &#8211; September), water is released at Wickiup Dam at a higher than historic rate to meet downstream irrigation demands. During the summer, the Upper Deschutes is flanked by wetlands that support habitat for a number of species including the Oregon Spotted Frog (Rana pretiosa). Decreased streamflow during the winter dewaters many wetland areas including the wetland ponds in the Benham-Dillon reach monitored here. This dataset provides information on the linkage between streamflow, river stage, and wetland inundation which could provide a mechanism for identifying flow thresholds for wetland inundation and thus inform flow management decisions.</purpose>

        <attracc>
            <attraccr>All water level loggers were lab-tested prior to instrument deployment to ensure consistent pressure and temperature readings. RTK-GPS surveys were regularly checked using locally placed benchmarks near Dillon Falls boat launch, Slough Recreation Site boat launch, as well as at the approximate midpoint of the river reach. Survey shots on the benchmarks were compared to each other to verify that the accuracy was within the desired tolerance. This dataset and metadata were reviewed by team members and an official USGS data release peer reviewer.</attraccr>
        </attracc>
        <logic>Map and profile view plots of the GPS survey data were created to visually inspect the data and identify erroneous or misclassified points. Water level logger elevations were compared to upstream and downstream instruments to inspect for relative elevation accuracy. Independent water surface elevation data collected from moving boats in March, July and October were used to validate temporal data integrity. Diurnal variation in water surface elevation beginning 20160720 coincide with daily temperature increases at the barometric pressure logger installed outside of the channel and may indicate environmentally influenced sensor error. However, diurnal water surface elevation variations beginning 20160720 are within the range of the vertical accuracy stated below. The Benham to Dillon reach has a low-gradient slope and in some cases adjacent water level loggers recorded similar water surface elevations due to small vertical changes in water surface elevation between loggers.</logic>
        <complete>Data set is considered complete for the information presented, as described in the abstract. Users are advised to read the rest of the metadata record carefully for additional details.</complete>
        <posacc>
            <horizpa>
                <horizpar>Horizontal locations of the water level loggers were determined during the March installation using a RTK-GPS rover radio linked to a static base station over a known control point. The location of the base station control point was refined by post processing the base station files using the National Geodetic Survey Online Positioning User Service (OPUS). Root mean square error of horizontal positions of the OPUS solution was 0.005 meters. Typical RTK-GPS rover horizontal position accuracy is 0.01 meters + 2 PPM. PPM is parts per million which describes the increase in error with distance of the rover away from the base station. Maximum distance of the rover to the base station during the March survey was 2,000 meters. Therefore, maximum horizontal position error of the rover was 0.014 meters. Total horizontal accuracy was determined by adding the base station and rover uncertainties in quadrature. Total horizontal accuracy is 0.015 meters.</horizpar>
            </horizpa>
            <vertacc>
                <vertaccr>Vertical accuracy was determined by combining the RTK-GPS accuracy and the reported accuracy of the water level logger. The elevation of each water level logger was computed using RTK-GPS surveyed water surface elevation measured near each water level logger between July 25 and July 28, 2016. The base station control point was determined by post processing the base station files using the National Geodetic Survey Online Positioning User Service (OPUS). Root mean square error of vertical positions of the OPUS solution (including the Geoid 12b uncertainty) was 0.021 meters. Typical RTK-GPS rover vertical position accuracy is 0.02 meters + 2 PPM. PPM is parts per million which describes the increase in error with distance of the rover away from the base station. During the July survey the base station was placed near the midpoint of the reach and maximum distance of the rover to the base station was 1,000 meters. Therefore maximum vertical position error of the rover was 0.022 meters. The Onset Hobo Water Level Loggers deployed in this study have typical errors of 0.03 meters with maximum errors of 0.06 meters. Total vertical accuracy was determined by adding the base station, rover, and water level logger uncertainties in quadrature. Total vertical accuracy is 0.067 meters. </vertaccr>

                <procdesc>Created a continuous water surface profile for the entire river reach by fitting a piecewise polynomial (smoothing spline) to 175 water surface elevation points surveyed along channel margins with a rod-mounted RTK-GPS antenna between July 25th and 28th. This best-fit regression approach accounted for noise in the water surface measurements due to instrument and physical measurement error. Water level loggers were fully submerged at the time of the July survey which prevented relocation. Streamwise distances between water level logger and the nearest survey points ranged from  0 to 46.66 meters (mean = 9.22 meters). Creation of the spline-generated water surface profile eliminated the need for survey points to be exactly colocated with water level loggers. Submerged depth recorded by the water level logger at the time of the nearest GPS-surveyed point and the elevation of the nearest spline-generated water surface profile vertex was used to calculate instrument elevation for each water level logger thus establishing a static datum for each logger. Water surface elevation was then calculated for all water level logger observations by adding the logger-measured submerged depth to the calculated instrument elevation. Water surface elevations in the two ponds were calculated by averaging surveyed water surface elevation points collected along the perimeter of each pond.</procdesc>
