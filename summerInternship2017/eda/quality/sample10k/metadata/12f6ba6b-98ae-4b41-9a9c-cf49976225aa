      <abstract>
The California Groundwater Units dataset classifies and delineates the State into one of three groundwater based polygon units:  (1) those areas defined as alluvial groundwater basins or sub-basins (DWR, 2002), (2) highland areas that are adjacent to and topographically upgradient of groundwater basins, and (3) highland areas not associated with any groundwater basin. In total, 938 Groundwater Units are represented.  The Groundwater Unit dataset relates existing groundwater basins with their newly delineated highland areas which can be used in subsequent hydrologic studies.  The method used to delineate highland areas is similar to methods used to delineate a contributing area, the difference being that highland areas are constrained to the immediately surrounding upslope (upsteam) area.

Highland areas were delineated based upon the surficial contributing area (watershed) immediately adjacent to each groundwater basin.  The method of delineation is comparable to the method used for stream segments.  However, highland areas are not intended to represent the entire surficial contributing area for a groundwater basin.  Upslope (upstream) groundwater basins, which may be contiguous with a downstream basin, are not included in the delineation for the downstream basin because the upstream basins will have their own highland areas delineated.  In addition, many groundwater basins in the Central Valley are divided along a river:  one groundwater basin along the right bank, and another along the left bank.  Therefore, each groundwater basin will have its own highland area delineated for each side of the river.  Groundwater units can be combined if desired.

Some groundwater basins do not have an associated highland because the basin was completely bordered by other groundwater basins, or a combination of groundwater basins and the ocean.
</abstract>
      <purpose>This dataset was developed to classify and delineate all areas of California into three categories which will be used in subsequent hydrologic studies.   Many studies and reports including the Groundwater Ambient and Assessment Program (GAMA) use the DWR groundwater basin (or sub-basin) as the basic unit.  With this dataset, it is now possible to relate a groundwater basin with its highland area.  Highland areas not associated with a groundwater basin were also identified.</purpose>

        <procdesc>

1) DEMs were downloaded, merged, and resampled to 300 meter pixel size using bilinear interpolation. Values were multiplied by 100 to convert vertical units from meters to centimeters.

2) Lake polygons were selected from the ESRI water bodies dataset by selecting FTYPE &lt;&gt; Canal/Ditch AND FTYPE &lt;&gt; Ice Mass AND SQMI &gt; 1.  Selected polygons were converted to a 300 meter raster dataset snapped to the DEM.

3) All river polylines were selected from the ESRI Regional Rivers dataset. Selected polygons were converted to a 300 meter raster dataset snapped to the DEM.

4) A 300 meter cell size raster dataset called lks_rivrs was created from the lake and river datasets and snapped to the DEM.  This dataset was burned into the DEM by -20 meters using the following expression: Con(IsNull(lks_rivrs),DEM,DEM-2000).

5) Sinks were filled using an unconstrained z. A flow direction grid was created using standard ArcGIS tools.

6) A tool was written to automate the highland generation process (The Highland tool). This tool essentially selected one groundwater basin at a time from the DWR groundwater basins dataset.  It re-codes the flow direction grid to 1000 (no flow) where all the other basins existed, essentially creating a custom flow direction grid for each groundwater basin selected.  This process prevented flow from one groundwater basin into another.  The ArcGIS Watershed tool was used to generate the highland area for each selected groundwater basin.  The process would repeat until all groundwater basins in the DWR dataset were processed.

7) All the individual highland areas generated from the Watershed tool were merged into one raster dataset and converted to a polygon dataset.

8) Groundwater basin polygons were erased from the highland dataset using the ArcGIS Erase tool. The ArcGIS Merge tool was used to add the groundwater basins polygons and create the CA_GWU dataset.

9) Areas outside of both groundwater basins and highland areas but within the State boundary of California were identified and classified as Highland area  Province.

10) Removed any sliver polygons that were created when merging the various datasets together and clipped by the cabnd dataset.
