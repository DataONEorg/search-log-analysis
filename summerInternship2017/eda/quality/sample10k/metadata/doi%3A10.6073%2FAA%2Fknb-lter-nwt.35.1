The study area was 60m x 125m. Soil  temperatures were measured at two depths (0 and 15 cm) at each of 13 locations  within the snowfence experiment area. Soil temperatures were measured at the  same depths at each of 6 control locations outside of but near the snowfence  experiment area. These measurements were made weekly to biweekly using fixed  thermistors and data loggers. Sampling locations were each given a unique  point identification number in order that these data could be incorporated  into the Saddle GIS. The snowfence was oriented in a northgsouth direction  and was 60m long. Each of the point identification numbers had a coordinate  within the experiment area. The first number of the coordinate was the  distance in m from the snowfence in an eastgwest direction, negative numbers  being west of the snowfence and positive numbers being east of the fence.   The second number in the coordinate was the distance in m from the southern terminus of the snowfence in a northerly direction. The point identification numbers and coordinates were: 203 (-40,30),  217 (-30,30), 231 (-20,30), 245 (-10,30), 252 (-5,30), 259 (5,30),  266 (10,30), 281 (20,30), 295 (30,30), 309 (40,30), 323 (50,30),  337 (60,30). Controls were located outside of the snowfence experiment  area: 113 (approximately 10 m south of the -30,0 coordinate) in the  Acomastylidetum rossii vegetation association, 114 (approximately 11 m  south of the -25,0 coordinate) in the Acomastylidetum rossii vegetation association, 115 (approximately 8 m south of the 55,0 coordinate) in the  Kobresietum myosuroidis vegetation association, 116 (approximately 5 m north  of the 50,60 coordinate) in the Kobresietum myosuroidis vegetation  association, 117 (approximately 3 m north of the -23,60 coordinate) in  the Rhodiolo integrifoliae vegetation association, 118 (approximately 5 m  north of the -21,60 coordinate) in the Rhodiolo integrifoliae vegetation  association.</para></abstract><keywordSet><keyword>NWT</keyword><keyword>Niwot Ridge LTER Site</keyword><keyword>LTER</keyword><keyword>Colorado</keyword><keyword>temperature</keyword><keyword>GIS</keyword><keyword>Saddle grid</keyword><keyword>altered snow regime</keyword><keyword>snow</keyword><keyword>snow effects</keyword><keyword>snowfence</keyword><keyword>soil</keyword><keyword>soil temperature</keyword></keywordSet><distribution scope="document"><online><url function="download">http://culter.colorado.edu/exec/.extracttoolA?snftemps.dw</url></online></distribution><coverage scope="document"><temporalCoverage scope="document"><rangeOfDates><beginDate><calendarDate>1992-10-23</calendarDate></beginDate><endDate><calendarDate>1995-10-01</calendarDate></endDate></rangeOfDates></temporalCoverage><geographicCoverage scope="document"><geographicDescription></geographicDescription><boundingCoordinates><westBoundingCoordinate>-105.643</westBoundingCoordinate><eastBoundingCoordinate>-105.3753</eastBoundingCoordinate><northBoundingCoordinate>40.0615</northBoundingCoordinate><southBoundingCoordinate>39.9932</southBoundingCoordinate></boundingCoordinates></geographicCoverage></coverage><maintenance><description><para>The documentation for this file was created by Susan Kindig in early  May of 1993, with additional information being supplied by Rick Ingersoll and Brad Lewis. Data for 23 October 1992 through 7 May 1993 were added to the data section at this time and the file was placed under sccs control.[SEK 7 May 1993] Data for 29 May 1993 were appended on 2 June 1993.[RCI 2 June 1993] Data for 3 June 1993 were appended on 4 June 1993.[RCI 4 June 1993] All data beginning 23 October 1992 were double-entered using EasyEntry programs (see &quot;The Management of NWT LTER Data on the PC&quot;) and then processed on a Sun SPARC 2 (see &quot;The Management of NWT LTER Data on culter&quot;). [RCI 14 June 1993] Data for 22 June 1993 were appended to the data section on 29 June 1993.[RCI 29 June 1993] Data for 2 and 19 July  1993 were appended to the data section on 23 July 1993.[RCI 23 July 1993] Data for 30 July 1993 were appended to the data section on  27 August 1993.[RCI 27 August 1993] Data for 11 December 1993 were appended to the data section on 14 December 1993.[RCI 14 December 1993] Data for 30 December 1993 were appended to the data section on 7 January 1994.[RCI 7 January 1994] Data for 15 January 1994 were appended to the data section on 28 January 1994.[RCI 28 January 1994] Data for 4 February were appended to the data  section on 8 February 1994.[RCI 8 February 1994] Data for 26 February and 17 March 1994 were appended to the data section on 5 April 1994. [RCI 5 April 1994] Data for 18 April 1994 were appended to the data section on 29 April 1994.[RCI 29 April 1994] Data for 9 April 1994 were inserted into the data section on 18 May 1994.[RCI 18 May 1994] Data for 2 June 1994 were appended to the data section on 7 June 1994.[RCI 7 June 1994] Data for 8 July 1994 were appended to the  data section on 13 July 1994.[RCI 13 July 1994] Data for 1 July 1994 were inserted in and data for 15, 22, 29 July, and 5 August 1994 were appended to the data section on 11 August 1994.[RCI 11 August 1994] Data for 12 August 1994 were appended to the data section on 17 August 1994.[RCI 17 August 1994] The locations of the point  identification codes 117 and 118 were transposed as originally provided. This error was pointed out by Brad Lewis on 24 August 1994 and the location codes in the comments section were corrected on that date.[RCI 24 August 1994] Data for 25 August 1994 were appended to  the data section on 26 August 1994.[RCI 26 August 1994] New  connections were added to the leads for the probes at point  identification codes 113 (C1), 114 (C2), and 259 (L1)on or prior to  7 May 1993. The color coding for these connectors was inadvertently  reversed so that the leads for the 0- and 15-cm probes appeared to be  for the 15- and 0-cm probes, respectively. The readings for those  probes from 7 May 1993 through 25 August 1994 were, in most cases, not  corrected by field or data entry personnel because they were unaware of  the switch. In late August 1994, in response to the anomalous readings for these probes in the summer of 1994, Brad Lewis dug up the probes and verified the switch. Brad then consulted the original hard-copy data sheets in conjunction with the data in this file and determined  the cases where the data needed to be corrected and those corrections  were made in the EasyEntry files, which were reprocessed. During this procedure, Brad noticed that the data for C5 (117) and C6 (118) had been switched for the 8 July 1994 data and these were corrected at this time as well. The 0- and 15-cm data transposition problems were corrected for 7 May 1993, 29 May 1993, 3 June 1993, 22 June 1993, 2 July 1993, 19 July 1993, 30 July 1993, 11 December 1993, 30 December 1993, 15 January 1994, 4 February 1994, 26 February 1994, 17 March 1994, 9 April 1994, 18 April 1994, 2 June 1994, and 8 July 1994 data. The erroneous data were deleted and the corrected data were imported on 29 August 1994.[RCI 29 August 1994] Data for 14 May 1994 were  inserted into the data section on 1September 1994.[RCI 1 September 1994] Data for 11 and 17 July 1995 were appended to the data section on 31 July 1995.[RCI 31 July 1995] Data for 31 July 1995 were appended to the data section on 21 August 1995.[MAH 21 August 1995] Data for 22 August 1995 were appended to the data section on 1 September 1995.[MAH 1 September 1995] Data for 7 and 14 September 1995 and  01 October 1995 were appended to the data section on 20 October  1995.[MAH 20 October 1995] The references to Walker et al. (1994) and Brooks et al. (1995) were added to the citations section on 2  May 1996.[MAH 2 May 1996] The timing section was updated to indicate that manual records were last taken on October 1, 1995. URL locations for related data were updated at that time as well.[MAH 27 September 2000]</para></description></maintenance><contact scope="document"><organizationName>Niwot Ridge LTER/University of Colorado</organizationName><positionName>Information Manager</positionName><address scope="document"><deliveryPoint>1560 30th Street, CB 450</deliveryPoint><city>Boulder</city><administrativeArea>CO</administrativeArea><postalCode>80309</postalCode><country>USA</country></address><electronicMailAddress>lternwt@colorado.edu</electronicMailAddress></contact><publisher scope="document"><organizationName>Niwot Ridge LTER/University of Colorado</organizationName><address scope="document"><deliveryPoint>1560 30th Street, CB 450</deliveryPoint><city>Boulder</city><administrativeArea>CO</administrativeArea><postalCode>80309</postalCode><country>USA</country></address><electronicMailAddress>lternwt@colorado.edu</electronicMailAddress></publisher><access authSystem="knb" order="allowFirst" scope="document"><allow><principal>uid=NWT,o=lter,dc=ecoinformatics,dc=org</principal><permission>all</permission></allow><allow><principal>public</principal><permission>read</permission></allow></access></dataset></eml:eml>
