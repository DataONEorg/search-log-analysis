				urban-rural gradient in Phoenix metropolitan region, USA, we elucidated the degree
				of urbanization-induced transformations of phenology and primary productivity. In
				this study we used time-series of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from
				the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and spatially interpolated
				rainfall. Our analyses were stratified by major land covers and dominant soil
				texture. We also assessed time scales at which NDVI responds most strongly to
				climatic factors. No distinctive patterns in phenology were found along the
				urban-rural gradient; however some important generalities were confirmed.
				Agricultural and urban developments introduce growth multimodality, which is not
				attributable to desert but customarily found in riparian ecosystems of the area.
				Despite the existence of summer flush of growth in the desert its signal is not
				detected by de-noised satellite data. Urban and agricultural vegetation is
				characterized by fast growth and senescence rates. While agriculture has the
				shortest growth length, most urban vegetation stays photosynthetically active for
				longer periods. Growth in the desert is controlled by precipitation accumulated for
				2-5 months. Spatial patterns of NDVI are predicted by precipitation grids. Positive
				relationship between these two variables changes seasonally reaching the maximum
				near the peak of annual growth. Spring and summer NDVI grids are in better agreement
				with longer term accumulated precipitation, but the early autumn growth is
				correlated more with immediate rainfall. Spatial and temporal correlations of desert
				NDVI with temperature are negative confirming the role of temperature in stimulating
				water loss from the soil. Our results supported the hypothesis that coarse-textured
				soils limit evaporative losses of soil water and promote growth. Riparian NDVI are
				moderately positively correlated with temperature but only weakly with
				precipitation. NDVI dynamics in urban and agricultural land covers are completely
				unsynchronized with natural vegetation communities and decoupled with precipitation.
				They exhibit positive, yet low, correlation with temperature. Overall, urbanization
				adds a greater diversity of phenological patterns that are not determined by
				climatic variability. Instead, urban and agricultural vegetation dynamics is
				expected to be explained largely by socio-economic variables.</para></abstract><keywordSet><keyword keywordType="place">Phoenix</keyword><keyword keywordType="place">Arizona</keyword><keyword keywordType="place">Sonoran Desert</keyword><keyword keywordType="theme">caplter</keyword><keyword keywordType="theme">Central Arizona Phoenix Longterm Ecological

							aboard TERRA/AQUA satellites have a revisit period of 1-2 days and
							collect data in 36 spectral channels at three spatial resolutions (250
							m, 500 m, and 1 km) with geolocation accuracy of approximately 50 m at
							nadir (Wolfe et al. 2002). NDVI is computed from reflectance data
							corrected for molecular scattering, ozone absorption and aerosols, and
							adjusted to nadir and Sun angles with the use of Bidirectional
							Reflectance Distribution Function (BDRF) models (Huete et al. 1999, van
							Leeuwen et al. 1999). The index is based on the property of green
							vegetation to strongly absorb red and reflect near-infrared wavelengths,
							and is calculated as (Tucker 1979, Huete et al. 1999): NDVI = (NIR -
							RED) / (NIR + RED) where NIR is MODIS band 2 (841-846 nm) and RED is
							MODIS band 1 (620-670 nm). Final 16-day maximum composites are produced
							by combining multiple days and filtering out clouds and data with bad
							integrity. We obtained 250-m NDVI images (MOD13Q1 product) for 2000-2005
							and examined data using quality flags from companion Quality Assurance
							(QA) images. Recognizing the existence of multiple methods for modeling
							phenology (Olsson and Eklundh 1994, Moulin et al. 1997, White et al.
							1997, Moody and Johnson 2001, Reed et al. 2003, de Beurs and Henebry
							2005, Bradley et al. 2007, Soudani et al. 2008), we chose to use TIMESAT
							(Jönsson and Eklundh 2006) to de-noise NDVI time-series and extract
							seasonality parameters. TIMESAT implements three processing methods
							based on least-squares fits to the upper envelope of NDVI time-series,
							accounting for negatively biased noise (Jönsson and Eklundh 2004). Data
							fitting with local polynomial functions classified as adaptive
							Savitsky-Golay filtering was preferred in our study. It most closely
							corresponded to raw NDVI data during calibration and method testing.
							Three adaptation runs were executed with search window set to 2, 3, and
							4 consecutive NDVI values. Start and end of growth periods were defined
							as a 20% increase or decrease in NDVI values. The TIMESAT software is
							available online:
