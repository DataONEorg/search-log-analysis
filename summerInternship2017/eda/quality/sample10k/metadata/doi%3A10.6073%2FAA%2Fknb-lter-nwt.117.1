Kobresia myosuroides foliage collected from Niwot Ridge  was dried and placed into 10x20 cm litter bags. About 2 g of plant  material were placed in the litter bags. One-hundred and sixty (160) litter bags were constructed of polyester mesh with a mesh size of  2mm^2. Forty (40) litter bags were placed inside of gopher mounds,  at the interface between the mounded (gopher excavated) soil and  the original soil surface (top of the O horizon), located on a  slope with a southern aspect. An additional 40 litter bags were placed  on the soil surface near these gopher mounds. The remaining 80 bags were similarly paired on gopher mounds and undisturbed soils on a  slope with a northern aspect. All litter bags were placed in the  field on 1 July 1993, and an initial harvest was done on the same date in order to assess the effect of handling and transport to the field. The second harvest was undertaken on 11 September 1993, at which time 31 bags were harvested. Retrieved litter bags were dried at  80 degrees Celsius for approximately 24 hr. The litter was removed from  the litter bags and weighed. Litter weight loss was calculated to  estimate decomposition rates. Four remaining harvests are scheduled: spring 1994, autumn 1994, spring 1995, and autumn 1995.</para></abstract><keywordSet><keyword>NWT</keyword><keyword>Niwot Ridge LTER Site</keyword><keyword>LTER</keyword><keyword>Colorado</keyword><keyword>Thomomys talpoides</keyword><keyword>decomposition</keyword><keyword>litter decay</keyword><keyword>mounds</keyword><keyword>pocket gopher</keyword><keyword>pocket gophers</keyword></keywordSet><distribution scope="document"><online><url function="download">http://culter.colorado.edu/exec/.extracttoolA?litdecom.rc</url></online></distribution><coverage scope="document"><temporalCoverage scope="document"><rangeOfDates><beginDate><calendarDate>1993-07-01</calendarDate></beginDate><endDate><calendarDate>1993-07-01</calendarDate></endDate></rangeOfDates></temporalCoverage><geographicCoverage scope="document"><geographicDescription></geographicDescription><boundingCoordinates><westBoundingCoordinate>-105.643</westBoundingCoordinate><eastBoundingCoordinate>-105.3753</eastBoundingCoordinate><northBoundingCoordinate>40.0615</northBoundingCoordinate><southBoundingCoordinate>39.9932</southBoundingCoordinate></boundingCoordinates></geographicCoverage></coverage><maintenance><description><para>The initial iteration of the documentation section of this file was generated by Roberto Cortinas and Rick Ingersoll in early May of  1994.
