      <abstract>These data were collected under a cooperative agreement with the Massachusetts Office of Coastal Zone Management (CZM) and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), Woods Hole Coastal and Marine Science Center (WHCMSC). Initiated in 2003, the primary objective of this program is to develop regional geologic framework information for the management of coastal and marine resources. Accurate data and maps of sea-floor geology are important first steps toward protecting fish habitat, delineating marine resources, and assessing environmental changes due to natural or human impacts. The project is focused on the inshore waters (5-30 m deep) of Massachusetts between the New Hampshire border and Cape Cod Bay. Data collected for the mapping cooperative have been released in a series of USGS Open-File Reports (http://woodshole.er.usgs.gov/project-pages/coastal_mass/). This is the spatial dataset for the Red Brook Harbor survey area within Buzzards Bay, Massachusetts.  These data are the results of a high-resolution geophysical (bathymetry, backscatter intensity, and seismic reflection) and ground validation (sediment samples and bottom photographs) survey, conducted in 2009.
In addition to inclusion within the USGS-CZM geologic mapping effort, these Red Brook Harbor data will be used to assess the shallow-water mapping capability of the geophysical systems deployed for this project, with an emphasis on identifying resolution benchmarks for the interferometric sonar system.  (http://woodshole.er.usgs.gov/operations/ia/public_ds_info.php?fa=2009-018-FA)</abstract>
      <purpose>This GeoTIFF image represents approximately 7 square kilometers of interferometric sonar backscatter data that were collected in Red Brook Harbor, Massachusetts, by the U.S. Geological Survey in 2009 as part of USGS survey 09018.  Data were collected with a Systems Engineering and Assessment Ltd. (SEA) SWATHplus interferometric sonar system.  These data are used to define the sea-floor morphology as part of the Massachusetts Sea-floor Mapping Project.  The cell size for this image is 5-meter by 5-meter.</purpose>

      <attraccr>Image pixel values contain acoustic reflectivity values normalized to an 8-bit data range (0-255).  Low-backscatter is represented by dark tones (low values) and high-backscatter is represented by bright tones (high values).</attraccr>
    </attracc>
    <logic>This image represents acoustic backscatter data from an interferometric sonar system.  This image was interpolated to close along-track gaps at nadir.  Data from main survey lines were incorporated in this image; no crossline data were included. Data gaps may remain between adjacent lines.</logic>
    <complete>All quality main survey line backscatter collected within the Red Brook Harbor survey area were incorporated in this image.  SXPTOOLS software was used to apply an empirical gain normalization, and to interpolate across data gasps at nadir that resulted from the filtering techniques applied to the bathymetric soundings.  Small gaps between adjacent survey lines may exist in the shallowest areas of the survey.  Tielines were not used to generate this image.  The western portion of line L40F1 was not included in the mosaic due to significantly different visual characteristics resulting from mis-applied acquisition settings.</complete>

      <horizpa>
        <horizpar>The SWATHplus transducers were mounted on a rigid, vertical pole, at the bow of the R/V Rafael, approximately 0.5 meters below the water line.  Navigation antennas (one Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS) antenna and two Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) GPS antennas) were mounted on a horizontal crossbar atop the vertical transducer mount pole.  The horizontal positions for soundings were acquired with an Octopus F180 Attitude and Positioning System integrated with a Novatel DGPS.  Horizontal sounding positions were recorded to raw sonar data files (SXR) via SWATHplus acquisition software (version 3.06.05.00).  Position data from an Ashtech Surveyor RTK GPS, a Novatel DL-V3 RTK GPS, and a CSI LGBX Pro DGP were recorded by HYPACK survey software to HYPACK raw files.  A conservative estimate of the positional accuracy of the CSI LGBX Pro DGPS unit is ± 2 meters.</horizpar>

        <srccontr>Bathymetric and backscatter data were collected using a Systems Engineering and Assessment, Ltd. SWATHplus (234 kHz) interferometric sonar system.  The SWATHplus transducers were mounted on a rigid pole, approximately 0.5 m below the water line, from the bow of the of the R/V Rafael of Woods Hole, MA.  A CodaOctopus F-180 Attitude and Positioning System, mounted directly above the SWATHplus transducers, measured vertical displacement (heave) and attitude (pitch and roll) of the vessel during data acquisition.  An Applied Microsystems Ltd. Micro SV sound velocimeter, mounted adjacent to the SWATHplus transducers, continually measured changes in sound-velocity near the sea surface, and a hand-casted, Applied MicroSystems SV Plus sound velocimeter was used to collect sound-velocity profiles of the entire water column at least once each survey day.   SWATHplus acquisition software was used to control the transducers and digitally log sonar data across an 80 m swath in SWATHplus raw (SXR) format.  To obtain 100 percent coverage of the seafloor, survey lines were spaced approximately 30 m apart.  The R/V Rafael maintained an average speed of 5 knots during survey operations.  An empirical gain normalization was applied to backscatter data to optimize the dynamic range of recorded intensities, and data was interpolated across gaps at nadir that resulted from the filtering methods applied to the bathymetric soundings.</srccontr>

        <procdesc>Edits to the metadata were made to fix any errors that MP v 2.9.32 flagged. This is necessary to enable the metadata to be successfully harvested for various data catalogs. In some cases, this meant adding text "Information unavailable" or "Information unavailable from original metadata" for those required fields that were left blank. Other minor edits were probably performed (title, publisher, publication place, etc.). Fixed a URL in the abstract. The source information was incomplete and had to be modified to meet the standard. The distribution format name was modified in an attempt to be more consistent with other metadata files of the same data format. The metadata date (but not the metadata creator) was edited to reflect the date of these changes. The metadata available from a harvester may supersede metadata bundled within a download file. Compare the metadata dates to determine which metadata file is most recent.</procdesc>

    <overview>
      <eaover>There are no attributes associated with this TIF image. Image pixel values contain acoustic reflectivity values normalized to an 8-bit data range (0-255) with the data range 0-254. Low-backscatter is represented by dark tones (low values) and high-backscatter is represented by bright tones (high values). The background color is set to 255 and can be turned off without removing data values.</eaover>
