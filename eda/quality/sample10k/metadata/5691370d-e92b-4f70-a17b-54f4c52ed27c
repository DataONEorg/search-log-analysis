    <descript>
      <abstract>Bear Lake is a tectonic lake that has existed for at least several hundred thousand years. The lake basin is a relatively simple half graben, a spoon-shaped depression tilted toward the main fault on the east side of the lake. The U.S. Geological Survey, in cooperation with researchers from several universities, has been studying the sediments of Bear Lake since 1996. The general purpose of this effort is to reconstruct past limnological conditions and regional climate on a range of timescales, from hundreds of years to hundreds of thousands of years. This research relates to a variety of human concerns, including water usage in
the Bear River basin. Past work has included several coring operations,
a seismic-reflection survey, sediment-trap deployments, a barge-mounted
drilling operation with the GLAD800 drill rig, and a variety of other studies.

The objectives of the September, 2002 operations, preliminarily reported here, were (1) to compile a detailed bathymetric map of the lake using swath-mapping techniques, in order to provide baseline data for a variety of applications and studies, and (2) to complete a sidescan-sonar survey of the lake, providing a nearly complete
acoustic image of the lake floor. Limited amounts of subbottom acoustic-reflection
data (CHIRP) were also collected, along with samples of lake-floor sediments representative of different kinds of backscatter patterns. These surveys followed an earlier subbottom acoustic-reflection survey (1997), using boomer and 3.5 kHz systems (S. M. Colman, unpublished data).

For more information on the seismic surveys see http://woodshole.er.usgs.gov/operations/ia/public_ds_info.php?fa=2002-031-FA

These data are also available via GeoMapApp (http://www.geomapapp.org/) and Virtual Ocean (http://www.virtualocean.org/) earth science exploration and visualization applications.</abstract>
      <purpose>JPG images of each seismic line were generated in order to incorporate images of the seismic data into Geographic Information System (GIS) projects and data archives utilizing HTML.  The JPG format is universal and enables hassle-free transfer of data. These data yield a pictoral view of the seismic data acquired.</purpose>

        <horizpar>WAAS (Wide Area Augmentation System) is assumed to be accurate within 1-2 meters. Standard GPS is assumed accurate within 5-10 meters. All WAAS data are referenced to WGS84.  The data were acquired with an Edgetech 424 kHz CHIRP sub-bottom profiler. The system was towed at the surface, close to the survey vessel. Horizontal accuracy is thus assumed to be within +/-3 meters.</horizpar>

        <procdesc>Raw SEGY-Y data were processed utilizing Colorado School of Mines Seismic Unix (SU) seimsic processing software. The seismic data were recorded with TEI Delph Seismics acquisition software.  Durinr processing, the SEG-Y data were converted to SU format. Gains were applied to the data to reduce noise and enhance the data. 'Mute' was used to remove all noise/signals within the water column. The data were then converted to postscript and JPG formats.</procdesc>
