To study seedling establishment, growth, and dynamics in riparian zones one m2 quadrats have been established. There are four sites which include one treatment site, where the rhododendron has been removed from the riparian zone, one hurricane site, where there is extensive disturbance from Hurricane Opal, and two control sites, one upslope from the treatment site and one upstream from the hurricane site. Each of these fours sites have ten randomly located natural regeneration one m2 quadrats as well as four randomly located replicates of three adjacent one m2 quadrats. In each of the three adjacent quadrats, the litter was removed from the lower half to determine the effect of litter on the germination and growth of seedlings. Two of the adjacent quadrats have been broadcast seeded with Acer rubrum, Liriodendron tulipifera, and Quercus rubra. In one of the two quadrats that have been broadcast seeded, a predator exclusion mesh screen, 1m x 1/2m with 1/4inch openings, has been installed in the quadrat to determine the effect of small mammal predation on regeneration. Quadrats were installed on 24 April 1997 and an initial vegetation survey was conducted in May 1997. All seedlings were permanently tagged at this time and quadrat physical characteristics such as slope, aspect, and distance from stream were recorded. Broadcast seeding was done on 21 May 1997. Each year censuses will be conducted in spring and fall on each quadrat and seedling species, density, age, and annual height growth will be recorded. This project will help to document the effect of Rhododendron maximum on regeneration in the riparian areas as well as the effect of hurricane disturbance on regeneration.</para><para>There are four sites, located in watershed 55, in this study. One treatment site, AR, had the rhododendron artificially removed in

August, 1995. The second treatment site, HR, experienced extensive disturbance from Hurricane Opal in October, 1995. These are the sites of the ongoing riparian study to determine the effect of removal of the streamside rhododendron on the export of hillslope nutrients (K, Na, Ca, Mg, N, P, S) and organic matter. There are two control sites. One is located upslope from the artificial removal site, AC, and the second is located upstream for the hurricane removal site, HC. These sites have not been disturbed.  Within each site, there are four randomly located replicates of three adjacent 1m2 quadrats, or plots.  Within each quadrat, there is a 1m x 1/2m subquadrat. Each subquadrat has had the litter removed from the lower 1/2m2 area and a mesh screen installed to separate the two areas.

Two of the subquadrats have been broadcast seeded with Acer rubrum, Liriodendron tulipifera, and Quercus rubra. On one of these two subquadrats, a predator exclusion mesh screen has been installed to exclude small mammals.  In addition to these plots, each site has ten randomly located natural regeneration 1m2 quadrats.</para></abstract><keywordSet><keyword>Coweeta</keyword><keyword>LTER</keyword><keyword>Seedling Establishment</keyword><keyword>Rhododendron maximum</keyword></keywordSet><intellectualRights><para>Must adhere to the Coweeta LTER Data Policy (See http://coweeta.ecology.uga.edu/webdocs/3/static/datapolicies.html).</para></intellectualRights><distribution scope="document"><online><url function="download">http://cwt33.ecology.uga.edu/summaries/summary2007.html</url></online></distribution><coverage scope="document"><geographicCoverage scope="document"><geographicDescription>WS55 - the riparian area.</geographicDescription><boundingCoordinates><westBoundingCoordinate></westBoundingCoordinate><eastBoundingCoordinate></eastBoundingCoordinate><northBoundingCoordinate></northBoundingCoordinate><southBoundingCoordinate></southBoundingCoordinate></boundingCoordinates></geographicCoverage><temporalCoverage scope="document"><rangeOfDates><beginDate><calendarDate>1997-05-01</calendarDate></beginDate><endDate><calendarDate>1997-05-01</calendarDate></endDate></rangeOfDates></temporalCoverage></coverage><contact scope="document"><positionName>Coweeta LTER Information Manager</positionName><address scope="document"><deliveryPoint>Institute of Ecology</deliveryPoint><deliveryPoint>University of Georgia</deliveryPoint><city>Athens</city><administrativeArea>Georgia</administrativeArea><postalCode>30602</postalCode><country>USA</country></address><phone phonetype="voice">(828) 524-2128</phone></contact><project scope="document"><title>Coweeta Long Term Ecological Research</title><personnel scope="document"><individualName><givenName>Ted</givenName><surName>Gragson</surName></individualName><address scope="document"><deliveryPoint>Institute of Ecology</deliveryPoint><deliveryPoint>University of Georgia</deliveryPoint><city>Athens</city><administrativeArea>Georgia</administrativeArea><postalCode>30602</postalCode><country>USA</country></address><electronicMailAddress>tgragson@earthlink.net</electronicMailAddress><role>principalInvestigator</role></personnel><personnel scope="document"><individualName><givenName>James</givenName><surName>Vose</surName></individualName><address scope="document"><deliveryPoint>Institute of Ecology</deliveryPoint><deliveryPoint>University of Georgia</deliveryPoint><city>Athens</city><administrativeArea>Georgia</administrativeArea><postalCode>30602</postalCode><country>USA</country></address><electronicMailAddress>jvose@fs.fed.us</electronicMailAddress><role>principalInvestigator</role></personnel><personnel scope="document"><individualName><givenName>Brian</givenName><surName>Kloeppel</surName></individualName><address scope="document"><deliveryPoint>Institute of Ecology</deliveryPoint><deliveryPoint>University of Georgia</deliveryPoint><city>Athens</city><administrativeArea>Georgia</administrativeArea><postalCode>30602</postalCode><country>USA</country></address><electronicMailAddress>kloeppel@sparc.ecology.uga.edu</electronicMailAddress><role>principalInvestigator</role></personnel><abstract><para>The Coweeta LTER Research Program has evolved since 1980 from a site-based to a site- and region-based project examining the effects of disturbance

and environmental gradients on biogeochemical cycling, and the underlying

watershed ecosystem processes that regulate and respond to those cycles. 

The objective for the 2002-2008 research is to advance scientific

understanding of the spatial, temporal, and decision-making components of

land use and land-use change in the southern Appalachian Mountains over the

last 200 years, and forecast patterns into the future 30 years.  This will

be accomplished by addressing ecological and socioeconomic aspects of

land-use change while continuing long-term studies of environmental

gradients and natural disturbance regimes.  The result will be a more

complete understanding of ecological dynamics in the southern Appalachian

Mountains that makes possible the development of reasonable forecasts of

its future ecological state. | The guiding hypothesis for the proposed research is that the frequency, intensity, and extent of land use represents human decision-making in

response to socioeconomic and bio-geophysical conditions with consequences

that cascade through ecosystems.  The research activities are organized

into three initiatives: (1) Characterization of the Socio-Natural Template,

(2) Ecosystem Responses to the Socio-Natural Template, and (3) Forecasting

Ecosystem Responses to Changes in the Socio-Natural Template.  The

integrated scientific research will provide both a description as well as

an explanation of the underlying causes of land use and the consequences of

land-use change for southern Appalachian ecosystems and society.  It thus

recognizes the complexity of land use as a process and the research needs

as defined in the LTER Program and the broader scientific community.</para></abstract><funding><para>National Science Foundation.
