        <othercit>The United States Geological Survey (USGS), in cooperation with the National Park Service (NPS) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), provides the coastal management community with digital elevation products.  The USGS processes aircraft lidar data provided by NASA, develops software tools and algorithms to use and analyze the data, and makes products available to the coastal management community.</othercit>

      <abstract>LiDAR is a remote sensing technique that uses laser light to detect, range, or identify remote objects based on light reflected by the object or emitted through it subsequent fluorescence.  Airborne ranging LiDAR is now being applied in coastal environments to produce accurate, cost-efficient elevation datasets with high data density.  The USGS in cooperation with NASA and NPS is using airborne LiDAR to measure the topography of Assateague Island National Seashore land features. Elevation measurements were collected over Assateague Island National Seashore using the NASA Experimental Advanced Airborne Research LiDAR (EAARL), a pulsed laser ranging system mounted onboard an aircraft to measure subaerial and submarine coastal topography. With the NASA EAARL LiDAR system, submarine data is generally acquired to a maximum of approximately 1.5 secchi depths (a measure of water clarity). The system uses a high frequency laser beam directed at the earth's surface through an opening in the bottom of the aircraft's fuselage. The laser system records the time difference between emission of the laser beam and the reception of the reflected laser signal in the aircraft. The Experimental Advanced Airborne Research LiDAR, developed by the NASA Wallops Flight Facility (WFF) in Virginia, measures ground elevation with a vertical resolution of roughly 15 centimeters. A sampling rate of up to 3 kHz results in an extremely dense spatial elevation data set.

For more information on Lidar science and the Experimental Advanced Airborne Research Lidar (EAARL) system and surveys, see http://ngom.usgs.gov/dsp/overview/index.php and http://ngom.usgs.gov/dsp/tech/eaarl/index.php .</abstract>
      <purpose>These LiDAR-derived topography maps were produced as a collaborative effort between the USGS Coastal and Marine Geology Program, NPS South Florida/Caribbean Network Inventory and Monitoring Program, and the NASA Wallops Flight Facility. One objective of this research is to create techniques to survey coral reefs and barrier islands for the purposes of geomorphic change studies, habitat mapping, ecological monitoring, change detection, and event assessment. As part of this project, data from an innovative instrument under development at the NASA Wallops Flight Facility, the NASA Experimental Airborne Advanced Research LiDAR (EAARL) are being used. This sensor has the potential to make significant contributions in this realm for measuring subaerial and submarine topography wthin cross-environment surveys. High spectral resolution, water-column correction, and low costs were found to be key factors in providing accurate and affordable imagery to costal resource managers.</purpose>
      <supplinf>Raw LiDAR data is not in a format that is generally usable by resource managers and scientists for scientific analysis.  Converting dense LiDAR elevation data into a readily usable format without loss of essential information requires specialized processing.  The USGS converts raw LiDAR data into a GIS-compatible map product to be provided to National Park Service GIS specialists, managers, and scientists.  The primary tool used in the conversion process is Airborne LiDAR Processing System (ALPS), a multi-tiered processing system developed by a USGS/NASA collaborative project for the use of subaerial and submarine LiDAR in coastal change assessment.  Specialized processing algorithms are used to convert raw waveform LiDAR data acquired by the EAARL to georeferenced spot (x,y,z) returns for topography.  These data are then converted to the NAD83 horizontal and NAVD88 vertical datum (using the Geoid 99 model). The final products are 2x2-km map tiles written out in a standard geotiff format with associated metadata information. These tiles are created for visual interpretation and regional quantitative analysis. Metadata files include the standard FGDC format.</supplinf>

      <attraccr>The expected accuracy of the measured variables are as follows: attitude within 0.07 degree, 3-cm nominal ranging accuracy, and vertical elevation accuracy of +/-20 cm for the "first return" surface.  Quality checks are built into the data-processing software.</attraccr>

    <logic>Each file contains data located in a 2-km by 2-km tile, where the upper-left bound can be assessed quickly through the file name. The first 3 numbers in the file name represent the left-most UTM easting coordinate (e###000) in meters, the next 4 numbers represent the top-most UTM northing coordinate (n####000) in meters, and the last 2 numbers (##) represent the UTM zone in which the tile is located (for example, ba_e123_n4567_20).</logic>
    <complete>Several regions of the dataset are labeled as "No Data", which corresponds to a cell value of -100 m in the GeoTiff file. These "No Data" areas are a result of the survey not covering a particular region, optical water depth of greater than 1.5 Secchi disc depths, or the manual removal of lidar processing artifacts.</complete>

        <procdesc>The data are collected using a Cessna 310 aircraft. The NASA Experimental Advanced Airborne Research LiDAR (EAARL) laser scanner collects the data using a green (532nm) raster scanning laser, while a digital camera acquires a visual record of the flight. The data are stored on hard drives and archived at the USGS office in St. Petersburg and the NASA office at Wallops Flight Facility. The navigational data are processed at Wallops Flight Facility.  The navigational and raw data are then downloaded into the Airborne LiDAR Processing System (ALPS).  Data are converted from units of time to x,y,z points for elevation. The derived surface data can then be converted into raster data (geotiffs).</procdesc>
