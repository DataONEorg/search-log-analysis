      <abstract>The Umpqua River drains 12,103 square kilometers (4,673 square miles) in southwest Oregon before flowing into the Pacific Ocean at Winchester Bay near the city of Reedsport. In cooperation with the Portland District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), the USGS evaluated sediment transport and gravel storage along the downstream alluvial reaches of the North and South Umpqua Rivers and the entire mainstem Umpqua River. This includes the lower 46.8 kilometers (29.1 miles) of the North Umpqua River and the lower 122.6 kilometers (76.2 miles) of the South Umpqua River. 
 
The Umpqua River gravel transport study involved multiple analyses, including tracking patterns of historical channel change and estimation of a sediment budget. To support these analyses, digital channel maps were produced to depict channel and floodplain conditions along the Umpqua River system from different time periods.

GIS layers defining the active channel of the Umpqua River system were developed for three time periods: 1939, 1967, and 2005. For the South Umpqua River and the 19 kilometers (12 miles) of the mainstem Umpqua River downstream from the confluence of the North and South Umpqua Rivers, GIS layers were also developed for the time periods 1994, 2000, and 2009.

For this project, the active channel was defined as area typically inundated during annual high flows, and includes the low-flow channel as well as side channels, islands, and channel-flanking gravel bars. The active channel datasets were developed by digitizing from aerial photographs. Aerial photographs from 1939 and 1967 were scanned, rectified, and mosaiced for this project. Digital orthophotographs from 1994, 2000, 2005, and 2009 are publicly available (See metadata for each photograph set for more information on the rectification process and resolution of each dataset). Although our study area encompasses the Umpqua River and lower reaches of the North and South Umpqua Rivers, the extent of each dataset depended upon the underlying aerial photographs; for example, the 1967 photographs extend only as far downstream as floodplain kilometer 7, whereas the 1939 and 2005 datasets extend to the mouth of the Umpqua River at the Pacific Ocean.</abstract>
      <purpose>These data were created to support the evaluation of sediment transport and gravel storage in the alluvial reaches of the Umpqua River system, Oregon. This mapping was used to track changes in channel morphology over time and to measure changes in gravel bar area and channel position.</purpose>

    <logic>Data are topologically correct in ArcGIS. Topology rules were used to edit features and verify that polygons were completely enclosed. Sliver polygons were manually removed.</logic>
    <complete>Data are complete. Digitizing was done at a scale of 1:3,000, except for the Tidal Reach, which was digitized at a scale of 1:10,000. The Tidal Reach was mapped at a smaller scale because the bar and channel features were much larger than in the other reaches.

All features greater than 300 square meters and clearly visible at digitizing scale were digitized. Because the polygons were split for assignment to study reaches, some may represent areas less than 300 square meters.
 
Where active channel features were obscured by vegetation or shadows, best judgment was used to delineate the feature boundary.
 
Varied stream discharge on different acquisition dates and misalignment from registration errors occasionally resulted in discontinuity of active channel features where the base photographs overlap. For these instances, the features were digitized as seen in the base photograph. Mean daily discharges for the dates of photo acquisition are included in the spreadsheet: Photo_sets_and_related_stream_discharge.xls</complete>

            <edomvd>Open water generally associated with alluvial features that does not convey the majority of flow. Most secondary water bodies were associated with alluvial features such as gravel bars or islands and could be classified as secondary channels, backwater sloughs or disconnected water bodies adjacent to alluvial features. A secondary channel is defined as a channel smaller than the main channel that conveys a smaller portion of the flow and is connected to the primary channel at both ends. Backwater features were generally abandoned secondary channels that were partially filled with sediment. Disconnected water bodies were typically floodplain ponds. Open water bodies that appeared on or near bedrock outcrops were not generally classified as secondary water features, because they typically represented inundated potholes or fractures in the bedrock. Exceptions to this rule were particularly large backwater areas and secondary channels located near bedrock outcrops which were mapped as secondary water features.</edomvd>

            <edomv>Attached bar</edomv>
            <edomvd>Areas of exposed bed-material sediment that share a margin with the floodplain.  Attached bars encompassed a range of features from thin patches of gravel overlying bedrock outcrops to large point bars and lateral bars. In many areas, it was difficult to distinguish bedrock from sediment in the aerial photographs, so differences in the tone and texture of features was used to discern the bar outline. Additionally, vegetation was used as a distinguishing characteristic because it was assumed that if an area could support vegetation, it was most likely mantled in sediment. Only the lower-lying portions of the bars that contained exposed sediment and appeared to be inundated on a near annual basis were digitized. Attached bars were often inset against higher-elevation terraces and floodplain features, with mature vegetation populating the older, higher surfaces, whereas the active surfaces had less vegetation and often had a lighter tone in the aerial photographs. At several locations, attached bars with mature vegetation were surrounded by active channel features, and were included within the bar classification. Attached bars may include open water and bedrock outcrops less than 300 square meters that were not differentiated from the main bar outline.</edomvd>

            <edomvd>Areas of exposed bed-material sediment that are completely surrounded by water. Although some medial bars appeared to be composed entirely of sediment, field observations showed that other medial bars had a thin mantle of sediment overlying bedrock. Hence, a designation of 'medial bar' does not have any implications as to the thickness of the deposited sediment. For this mapping, no distinction was made as to whether or not the bar consisted of gravel, sand, or mud. In many areas, it was difficult to distinguish bedrock from sediment in the aerial photographs, so differences in the tone and texture of features was used to discern sediment from bedrock. Vegetation was used as a distinguishing characteristic, because it was assumed that if an area could support vegetation, it was most likely mantled with sediment. Medial bars may include open water and bedrock outcrops less than 300 square meters that were not differentiated from the main bar outline.</edomvd>

            <edomv>Bedrock outcrop</edomv>
            <edomvd>Exposed bedrock within the active channel. This class includes islands and outcrops adjacent to the wetted channel. For outcrops adjacent to the primary channel, areas of 'bare' bedrock were delineated by drawing boundaries between the edge of the wetted channel and dense vegetation bordering the outcrop. Bedrock was only delineated if it was not covered by vegetation. Distinguishing bedrock from sediment was difficult in some locations, but in other places, the bedrock could be easily differentiated from gravel bars by parallel ridges and fractures in the bedrock and by the jagged, irregular borders of the outcrops. When in doubt about whether a feature was bedrock or a sediment deposit, it was often assumed that if the feature is bedrock in the National Agriculture Imagery Program color aerial photographs from 2005, it was bedrock in previous times also. Because of their higher resolution, it was easier to distinguish bedrock from sediment in the photographs from 2005. Exceptions to this assumption were where gravel-mantled bedrock was clearly visible in the photograph and where erosion of deposited sediment had clearly occurred. Where exposed bedrock extended outside of the active channel, its boundary was determined by tonal differences, with bedrock within the active channel generally having a lighter tone than areas not subject to inundation and scour. In some areas, bedrock outcrops were interspersed with water or sediment. Where this was observed, the polygon was delineated as whichever feature occupied more than 50 percent of the area. Therefore, some bedrock polygons include areas of water, or small patches of sediment. Ponded water was present along many bedrock outcrops generally as shallow puddles in fractures and potholes in the bedrock and during low flows were isolated from the main flow of the channel.</edomvd>
