 <abstract><para>We monitored densities of molting harlequin ducks and broods in oil spill area of western Prince William Sound (WPWS) and in the non-oiled eastern area (EPWS) during 1989-1993. A survey of sea duck foods was consistent with the literature, showing diverse prey in harlequins and the importance of mussels to goldeneyes and scoters. The shoreline density indices of molting harlequin ducks in in WPWS was consistently lower than those in EPWS. These data indicate that the densities of molting harlequin ducks were greater in the unoiled portions of PWS, suggesting differential use because of oil effects or regional ecological differences. Differences in survey timing and coverage among years contributed an unknown margin of error in comparisons across years and regions. The lack of pre-spill baseline population data and habitat differences between WPWS and EPWS preclude distinguishing oil spill effects from other ecological or demographic variation.</para>

 <methods><methodStep><description><section><title>Population Monitoring, 1993</title>
 <para>We conducted shoreline surveys to determine location and distribution of harlequin ducks within coastal habitats. Surveys were conducted by 2-3 observers aboard a skiff (2-7 m in length) at a distance of 5-50 m from shore, around islands, exposed rocks, and into embayments, lagoons and stream deltas. We used low speeds (0-10 km/hr) when searching for harlequin ducks in shoals and emergent rocky habitat. Higher speeds (up to 30 km/hr) were used when searching nearshore, deep water habitat not generally used by molting harlequin ducks. We avoided surveying when weather and seas limited visibility. When harlequin ducks were encountered the engine was turned off and skiff was allowed to drift quietly toward the flock.</para>
 <para>Harlequin ducks were counted and classified to sex when possible using 10x binoculars. Harlequin ducks exhibit sexual dimorphism, including in body size. Adult females are approximately 85% the size of adult males by weight (bellrose, 1980, Crowley and Patten, 1996). Molting males appear larger and darker than females. Males appear predominately black or dark brown, adult males have white wing markings, subadult males have mottled bellies. Females are lighter brown, have less distinct face patches, no white wing marking, and have mottled, cream-colored bellies. The dark colored heads and distinctive face patch of males were the most reliable indicators in separating molting males from females.</para>
 <para>Surveys in EPWS and WPWS were conducted simultaneously, although WPWS surveys required more time to complete because of greater distances covered, and generally poorer weather conditions. We derived a shoreline density index (SDI = number of ducks per km of shoreline surveyed) of harlequins for comparison of study areas and years.</para>
 <para>Selection of survey areas was prioritized first on covering areas surveyed in previous years (particularly where harlequins were observed), then on additional coverage where harlequins might be present (i.e. shallow sloping beachers rather than steep bluffs and cliffs). No effort was made to randomize coverage, but rather to maximize coverage and harlequins counted.</para>
 <para>We recorded habitat types used by molting harlequin ducks. Areas surveyed and sites occupied by harlequin ducks in WPWS were identified by a system of numbered beach segments used by clean-up crews. This segment system provided a history of initial oiling conitions and clean-up activities within habitats used by harlequin ducks. Because mussel beds retained more oil relative to the surrounding environment through 1993, and mussels are a localized food source important to harlequins the proximity of molting flocks to mussel beds was recorded. Distances of molting harlequins to mussel beds were classified as within or not within easy swimming distnace of flightless ducks.</para>

 <methodStep><description><section><title>Productivity Monitoring, 1993</title>
 <para>We recorded broods of harlequins encountered during boat surveys. Ducklings were classified by plumage characteristics into one of seven age class: IA-III to preclude misidentification with molting females. The following criteria for identification of broods were compiled from previous years observations of broods particularly from EPWS where broods were compiled from previous years observations of broods, particularly from EPWS where broods were more commonly observed from hatchling to near-fledging age classes.</para>
 <para>Harlequin ducklings observed in July and early August were distinguishable from females by smaller size, presence of down, and broody behavior. As ducklings approached adult size (class III), they became more difficult to differentiate from adult females. Upon scrutiny with 10x binoculars, remnant down on head or back was sometimes apparent on ducklings. Ducklings also had darker faces and bills than females. The large face patch on ducklings was graying instead of white, and body plumage appeared slightly lighter than that of females. Ducklings had rounded, vascularized wing-tips compared to molting adults, which has pointed wing tips when primary feathers were molted or not fully grown. For adult-sized ducklings, approaching slowly by boat helped distinguish broods from mixed flocks of molters. When less than 30 m from suspected broods and using 10x binoculars, behavioral observations helped distinguish class IIc and III ducklings from females. Molting or flight-capable adults swam rapidly or few away, while ducklings followed the female, responded to her calls, and were unable to escape by rapid swimming. We believe that these criteria were fairly reliable through class II ducklings. However, small flocks of molting females were sometimes indistinguishable from class III broods. When in doubt, we classified these groups as molting females rather than as broods.</para>
 <para>Brood surveys were best conducted during the last week of July and first 2 weeks of August, after hatching was essentially complete and before fledging began because fledged ducklings were nearly impossible to distinguish from females. SDIs of broods (number of broods/100 km) were compared between study areas and survey years.</para>

 <methodStep><description><section><title>Sea Duck Collection</title>
 <para>Because authorization to spend funds and commence this study was not received from U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service until August 1989, no sea ducks (other than those killed directly by the sill) were collected between the date of the Exxon Valdez spill and September 1989. Collection procedures involved locating groups of birds; observing group composition and behavior, especially foraging activity; and either stalking or pursuing birds into suitable collection range. The ducks were taken by 12-gauge shotgun. All birds were immediately retrieved, labeled with time, date, original location, circumstances of collection, species, and sex-age class being recorded. Data were recorded in field notebooks and maps. Carcasses were kept on ice or cooled until processing at base camp or laboratory. Field handling of all birds followde a departmental protocol developed for oil spill collections (Appedix 2). All birds and subsequent samples were preserved and submitted through established oil spill chain-of-custody procedures.</para>

 <methodStep><description><section><title>Food Habits Sampling</title>
 <para>During necropsy all food items in the proventriculus were transferred to chemically clean jars, examined and described in a preliminary manner, and frozen. THe primary purpose of these samples was to test for petroleum exposure, precluding the use of fixatives to preserve organisms. Food habits analysis was of secondary importance. To develop a data base of prey organisms, food items were later identified to genus level in the laboratory. The food items were counted and measured to length without removal from clean storage jars in order to avoid potential petroleum contamination. Gizzard material was not used to evaluate diets because of biases associated with differential digestion and detectability.</para>
 <para>Data from food items were compiled to determine both how commonly prey species were found among ducks of each species (occurrence) and the importance of prey taxa as food (a function of number consumed and size of prey animals). Frequencies of occurrence for prey items were calculated from lists of food items for each duck species. Avoidance of preservatives may have allowed post-mortem digestion to dissolve soft-bodied foods.</para>
 <para>Food items from all birds were to be chemically analyzed for hydrocarbons and could not handled, dried, or immersed in fluid (displacement method) without risk of contamination. Consequently,  we used indirect measures (lengths for individual prey items) and generated a sum of lengths as a relative length-important index. Our method is less precise than use of relative volume indices because length: volume relationships that vary among prey species were not obtained. Our primary purpose was to test foods for petroleum contamination. Use of prey length allowed a practical means to approximate relative importance among food taxa.</para>

 <methodStep><description><section><title>Petroleum Contamination Sampling</title>
 <para>The following procedures were followed to asses whether sea ducks consumed and metabolized contaminated food in the oiled area. Samples of liver, bile, and food items from the proventriculus were collected for analysis of petroleum contamination. Samples were taken with chemically cleaned instruments in clean environments, and frozen in chemically cleaned jars.</para>

 <methodStep><description><section><title>Surveys of Contaminated Habitats and Mussel Beds</title>
 <para>To asses the broader impacts of oil on harlequin ducks, particularly long-term contamination of feeding sites, records of the Federal On-Scene Coordinator and Oil Spill Public Information Center were abstracted into lists of oiled habitats and sites treated with chemical remediation. The term mussel &quot;beds&quot; is not precisely defined in our usage, but applies to aggregations similar to those described by Babcock et al. (1994), generally 15-100% cover of the substrate and often in multiple layers. Locations, physical site descriptions, harlequin duck sightings, and amount and condition of oil were recorded by beach segments with known histories.</para>

 <methodStep><description><section><title>Preliminary Harlequin Duck Surveys, 1990</title>
 <para>In order to assess feasibility of harlequin duck restoration, Alaska Department of Fish and Game Commercial Fisheries technicians were asked to make opportunistic records of harlequin ducks and broods along andromous fish streams in oiled and unoiled ares of Prince William Sound during the summer of 1990, while conducting fisheries surveys. Fisheries crews walked each stream from the intertidal zone to the upper limit of salmon distribution, searching for harlequin ducks. They also conducted extensive shorelines searches for harlequin broods in the oil spill area in summer 1990.</para>
 <para>Surveys were initiated on Hawkins and Hinchinbrook Islands, and continued northward on the mainland of eastern PWS from the Eyak River near Cordova to Valdez. The surveys included the Coghill River in College Fjord in northwestern PWS, and continued southward onthe mainland of western PWS from Port Nellie Juan to Jackpot Bay and Bainbridge Passage. The surveys also included streams on Chenega, Knight, Bainbridge, Evans, Latouche, Green and Montague Islands.</para>
 <para>Additional information on harlequin summer distribution in Prince William Sound was provided by USFWS teams during the course of their oil spill studies.</para>

 <methodStep><description><section><title>Harlequin Duck Surveys, 1991-1992</title>
 <para>Boat surveys were conducted from mid-May through June (breeding season) and during July and August (post-breeding season) in both years throughout the western PWS oil spill area to determine numbers, distribution, and habitat associations of harlequin ducks. The surveys included islands, bays and the mainland from Port Nellie Juan south to Port Bainbridge and east to Montague island. USFWS studies contributed systematic survey data on adult harlequins and broods in 1991 around the Naked Island group and Eleanor Island, and accumulated observations from daily boat work during the summer of 1992. As part of Restoration Study No. 71, all suitable harlequin breeding streams and suitable shoreline habitat in unoiled eastern PWS was surveyed from Valdez to Cordova in 1991 and 1992.</para>
 <para>Observations of harlequin ducks were recorded in four general habitat types. Coastal habitats are typically intermingled as patches of diverse landforms and water. Therefore, we did not use a system of detailed exclusive habitat classes. In this report, harlequin ducks were tallied in Mussel Bed and Offshore Rock habitat classes, if they were on such specific sites. If not, they were counted in general Stream Mouth and Bay &amp; Lagoon types. Harlequin ducks were tallied on Oiled Mussel Beds when they were seen actually on oiled beds documented by Restoration Study 103 or this study, not when they were merely within a segment containing oiled beds.</para>
 <para>On all surveys, harlequins were counted and, whenever possible, classified by sex and age. Sex ratios are difficult to determine from mid-summer to September because subadult harlequin males have plumages that, to varying degrees, resemble females. In addition, adult males lose their breeding plumage during molt in July. Although males may be aged carefully from fall through early suumer, there are no obvious plumage features of female age classes. Identifying juvenile harlequin young of the year may be done by presence of down during brood rearing. However, once all contour feathers are in after mid-August, it is very difficult to distinguish juveniles from females and subadult males without close inspection. The presence of a flighted bird with a group of flightless others is not a reliable sign, given the mixture of birds at different molt states in late summer. Our brood surveys were conducted after all familes would have been on coastal waters, yet early enough to detect downy broods; due caution was used to thorougly examine all suspected brood groups.</para>
 <para>Presence of harlequins or harlequin pairs on or near streams indicated probable use of these streams for breeding.</para>
 <para>Shoreline coverage reported in km for each survey during this project represents one complete survey, with no duplication coverage included. Shoreline lengths of duck surveys in weetern PWS were computed from official state/federal shoreline database developed by USFS as the standard for quantifying EVOS shoreline data. Survey lengths for eastern PWS were determined from electronic planimeter measurements on maps of the same scale.</para>
 <para>Average shoreline densities for spring, molt and brood censuses were derived from complete counts of harlequins divided by the total length of the survey. The survey included all habitat types. Shoreline densities for specific habitat types and oiling conditions were derived by dividing the number of harlequins by the same of the length of the segments in which the ducks were observed.</para>

 <methodStep><description><section><title>Monitoring Streams for Breeding Activity, 1991-1992</title>
 <para>Breeding harlequin ducks fly along stream corridors between coastal feeding areas and upstream nest sites in Prince William Sound, primarily during twilight hours. During 1991 and 1992, mist-netting was employed to both sample breeding bird activity on potential nestring streams in oiled and unoiled areas, and to captures adults for subsequent studies of nesting. We used mist nets suspended over streams, usually within 100 m of the coast. We monitored streams from late May through early July. Nets were deployed and monitored for an average of nine hours, usually between 1900-0800 hours.</para>
 <para>The selection of streams for monitoring differed somewhat between the eastern and western study areas. In eastern PWS, we selected streams based primarily on observations of harlequins near the stream mouth during spring surveys. We also selected streams with characteristics similar to known harlequin streams, but where we observed no harlequins during surveys. These streams were given a lower priority for trapping. Finally, we selected streams that were within the same vicinity of a known harlequin stream, regardless of habitat characteristics, to collect a sample of streams not used by breeding harlequin ducks.</para>
 <para>Unlike eastern PWS, there were few harlequins observed near stream mouths during spring surveys of western PWS. Therefore, most streams monitored in western PWS were selected based on their similarity to known breeding streams throughout Prince William Sound. In general, the largest streams in western PWS received highest priority for monitoring.</para>
