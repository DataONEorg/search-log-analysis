      <abstract>The Sprague River drains 4090 square kilometers in south-central Oregon before flowing into the Williamson River and upper Klamath Lake. In cooperation with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the USGS and University of Oregon conducted a study to evaluate channel and floodplain processes for the 131 km of the Sprague River and its major tributaries, including the lower 20 km of the South Fork Sprague River, the lower 16 km of the North Fork Sprague River, and the lower 62 km of the Sycan River. The study involved multiple analyses, including assessments of historical channel change, riparian and floodplain vegetation, and surficial geology. To support these analyses, digital floodplain and channel maps were prepared from historic notes, maps, and aerial photos to depict channel and floodplain conditions at different times between 1866 and 2005. The geospatial database of current and historic channel and floodplain conditions will also enable evaluation of long-term trends pertaining to aquatic and riparian habitat conditions.</abstract>
      <purpose>These data were created to support understanding of geomorphic conditions and historical changes to channel and floodplain conditions for the Sprague River and the lower portions of its major tributaries. GIS layers depicting channel centerlines, water features, fluvial bars, floodplain vegetation, and floodplain features such as irrigation canals, levees and dikes, and roads were created from aerial photographs dating from 1940, 1968, and 2000. The purpose of this mapping was to track changes in channel and floodplain morphology and vegetation over time and to measure changes in channel position. Historical aerial photographs from 1940 and 1968 were acquired, scanned, and rectified for this project, while digital orthophotographs from 2000 are publicly available. (See metadata for each photograph set for more information on the rectification process and resolution of each dataset). In addition, channel centerlines were mapped from publicly available coverages for 1975 (Natural Resources Conservation Service Soil Survey of Klamath County) and 2005 (U.S. Department of Agriculture NAIP imagery). The surficial geologic mapping was done to support understanding of the geologic context of the modern floodplain, and encompasses the alluvial valleys of the Sprague River and the lower portions of the Sycan, North Fork, and South Fork Sprague Rivers.</purpose>

    <logic>Topology rules were used to clean and edit features digitized within the floodplain boundary data set for overlap and boundary accuracy.  A separate topology was run to edit digitizing overlap with the floodplain boundary data set and the features digitized within it to ensure all features were enclosed within the final floodplain boundary.</logic>
    <complete>Data are complete. River centerline is defined as a line digitized by eye that approximates the centerline of the Primary Channel for the Sprague, North Fork Sprague, South Fork Sprague and Sycan Rivers.  Five different river centerlines were digitized from five year sets (1940s, 1968, 1975, 2000, 2005).  For digitized year sets 1940s, 1968 &amp; 2000, mid-channel bar features were ignored when delineating the centerline.  Centerline was established as the point between the channel edges.</complete>

        <procdesc>Rectification:  The photo rectification process warps an image across a set of specified points.  The warping leaves the edges of the image less spatially accurate than the center portion of the image.  To ensure the best accuracy of data, feature digitizing occurred nearest the center of the photo as possible on the rectified 1940s and 1968 photo sets.  One photo was exchanged for a bordering photo at approximately the mid-point of photo overlap.  Digitization on a photo's edge only occurred on the final most distal photo when there was no adjacent photo available. The historic 1940 aerial photo set rectified to the USGS 2000 DOQs. A goal of 20 ground control points (GCP) per photo was established (actual: 11-35 GCPs/photo).  Hard point landscape features (building or fence corners) were prioritized for rectification, then "soft point" features (trees, etc.) were used. GCP selection prioritized points nearest the river and the active floodplain to ensure accuracy of rectification warping in the study area. A goal of an RMSE &lt; 5m was established (actual: 1.75-4.5, with one outlier in a canyon section with and RMSE of 6.01).  Rectification of photos used 2nd order polynomial.</procdesc>

        <procdesc>Digitizing:  1940 water features and river centerlines digitized. Completed in 2008.  Digitizing Protocol: The Sprague River Project is focused on geomorphic and vegetation changes over time within the active geomorphic floodplain of the Sprague River watershed. We defined the active geomorphic floodplain as the area adjacent to the channel system that is low-lying and displays geomorphic features typical of channel erosion and depositional processes clearly on imagery, including aerial photos, 7.5 min USGS topo maps, and LIDAR images (Watershed Sciences, 2005).  Geomorphic features used to define the extent of the active geomorphic floodplain included point bars, scroll bars, abandoned channels (including oxbows ponds and filled channels), and swell and swale topography.  The active geomorphic floodplain was distinguished from adjacent alluvial surfaces that are smoother and show less evidence of erosion and deposition, although some of these adjacent surfaces may be flooded regularly by overbank flows. Digital data sets were first digitized from the 2000 DOQs.  High resolution LiDAR imagery data (Watershed Sciences, 2005) was used to identify topographic details that assisted in feature classification.  If the feature visible in the LiDAR was not visible in the 2000 DOQ the feature was not digitized.  Additional comparison with the 1998 color air photo mosaic (USFWS 1998) aided in evaluating the 2000 DOQs. The 2000 digital data was then used as a template for digitizing features from the 1968 and 1940s photo sets.  Because the spatial context of this project is focused within the active geomorphic floodplain, interpreting and digitizing the floodplain boundary was prioritized to define area of digitization in all three year sets. Original data sets were digitized in ArcMap as separate shapefiles (line or polygon).  Line files were "buffered" in ArcMAP to generate polygons with a calculable area for these features. All digitizing was reviewed and edited by the graduate research assistants or project leaders for interpretation consistency and data accuracy.  After editing, the shapefiles were input into a geodatabase.  The geodatabase was used to organize the data sets by data type and subtype, feature prioritization, and topology rules.</procdesc>
