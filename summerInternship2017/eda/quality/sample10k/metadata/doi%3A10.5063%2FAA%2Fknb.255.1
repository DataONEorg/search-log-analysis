<abstract>
<para>The Cary Institute Environmental Monitoring Program is a long-term program to monitor environmental parameters that are important to natural ecosystems. The program includes monitoring of air, precipitation and stream chemistry as well as meteorological, solar radiation and physical stream parameters. The Cary Institute also hosts sites for two additional programs: The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation Ambient Air Monitoring Program, for ground level ozone and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), U.S. Climate Reference Network (USCRN).  For an overview of the program, visit http://www.caryinstitute.org/emp_overview.html.</para>

<geographicDescription>The Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies is located in the Hudson River Valley near Millbrook, New York, roughly 113 km north of New York City and 24 km east of Poughkeepsie.  Stream gauging, temperature and specific conductance equipment is located on the East Branch of Wappinger Creek in the Fern Glen on the Cary Institute property. GPS coordinates for the site are N41.78707, W73.73317. The stream is a tributary to the main branch of Wappinger Creek, which flows into the Hudson River at Wappingers Falls.  Approximately 1.6 km upstream from the gauging station is the Village of Millbrook sewage treatment plant. In addition to the sewage treatment plant, Dietrich Pond and its associated dam can influence the stream at the gauging station.  </geographicDescription>

<title>Stream Hydrology, Temperature and Specific Conductance Data</title>
<para>Stream gauging equipment is situated in a stilling well, which is located on the leeward side of an old bridge abutment. Stream height is monitored using a float and pulley system with a graduated tape (formerly a wire). The pulley is connected to an incremental shaft encoder, which is monitored using a datalogger. Stream temperature is monitored using a temperature sensor, which sits on the bed of the stream near the stilling well. Instantaneous height and temperature measurements are recorded and stored every fifteen minutes. Rating curves for estimating stream discharge were developed in 1987-1988, 1993-1994, 1996, 1997-1998 and 2003-2005 with periodic points checked in intervening years.  Stream height was measured between 1986 and 1991 using a Leupold and Stevens, Inc. total flow meter (model 61R) connected to a float and pulley. Stream temperature was measured between 1987 and 1993 using a Weksler Instruments Corporation, Temperature Chart Recorder, 10 inch. Data collected prior to 1993 can be made available on request. In 1993, we began continuous collection of stream height and temperature using a Handar, Inc. 570A Data Acquisition System with an incremental shaft encoder (model 436A) and a water temperature sensor (Handar, Inc., model 433FN 1993-Sept. 2003; Campbell Scientific model CS547A May 2005-present). Stream height is checked weekly with a fixed staff gauge (Sept. 1997-present) and with a graduated tape on the pulley (July 2002-present). The Handar 570A datalogger was replaced with a Campbell Scientific CR510 datalogger in September 2003. We began continuous stream conductivity measurements in May 2005 using a Campbell Scientific CS547A conductivity and temperature probe.
