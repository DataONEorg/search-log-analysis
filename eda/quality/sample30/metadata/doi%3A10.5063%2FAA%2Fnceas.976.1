<abstract>
<para>This dataset contains demographic data for Cynoglossum officinale L. (Boraginaceae) collected at 3 sites in its native range and 3 sites in the introduced range from 2004 to 2007 (sampled 2 times/year). These data were used to parameterize integral projection models to investigate differences in life history between the native and introduced range (Williams 2009) and to investigate the impacts of native specialist insects and small-scale disturbances on population growth (Williams et al. 2010). Individual fate and size data of marked and mapped individuals in 1 m x 10 m transects were collected at 2 censuses per year (spring and summer), seed production was measured during the summer census; new seedlings were added each spring. These are all the data required to parameterize a population model (matrix model or  integral projection model). This dataset includes 3 tables: 1) location of individual (to the nearest decimeter); 2) fate, size and amount of leaf herbivory at each census; 3) seedling fate in each transect (the fate of individuals was not followed).

<title>Demographic data collection for Cynoglossum officinale</title>
<para>At each site, I followed the demographic fate of all individuals in two 1 ? 10 m transects that included at least 100 plants.  These transects were lengthened to include enough individuals in the native range, where densities were lower.  New seedlings were marked in the spring (April in Germany, May in Montana) and uniquely tagged the following summer, when they were one-year olds.  At each census, the size of all plants was recorded by counting the number of leaves and measuring the length of the longest leaf; in some years, the root crown diameter (diameter at the soil surface) was also measured.  At the summer census (early July in Germany, late July in Montana), plants have set seed, and the number of seeds produced was estimated by counting the number of inflorescence branches, known as cymes (number of seeds = exp(1.882 + 1.229*(log(number of cymes)); R2 = 0.78, F1,297 = 1028.0, P &lt; 0.001). Details on the transition from seed to seedling, as well as the longevity of seeds in the seedbank are reported elsewhere with mean parameter estimates for each site (Williams et al. 2010).</para>

<para>Data were collected from 3 field sites in the native range (near Halle, Saxony-Anhalt, Germany): Site 1. Salziger See. (51 degrees 29?N; 011 degrees 44?E, elevation 111 m); Site 2.  Hohenerxleben. (51 degrees 51?N; 011 degrees 38?E, elevation 73 m); Site 3.  Aseleben. (51 degrees 28?N; 011 degrees 41?E, elevation 132 m), and from 3 sites in the introduced range (near Missoula, MT, USA): Site 4.  Lavalle Creek.  (46 degrees 58?N; 114 degrees 04?W, elevation 1212 m); Site 5.  Ninemile Prairie. (46 degrees 57?N; 113 degrees 32?W, elevation 1101 m); Site 6.  Lubrecht Experimental Forest. (46 degrees 52?N; 113 degrees 25?W, elevation 1640 m). In the published work, data from the summer censuses (July) were used, but here data from both spring (April/May) and summer censuses are included for the years 2004 - 2007. Size of plants was measured at both censuses, but seed production data were only collected during the summer census (after plants had set seed).</para>

<samplingDescription>
<para>I selected three study populations located in the center of each range that occurred in broadly representative habitats, and that minimized climatic differences so that differences between ranges would not be obscured by large differences in climate.  Thus, the study populations were not chosen randomly, but were selected such that gross habitat structure and climate would be similar at sites across continents. </para>
