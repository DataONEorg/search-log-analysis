      <abstract>The Arctic Coastal Plain of northern Alaska is an area of strategic economic importance to the United States, is home to remote Native American communities, and encompasses unique habitats of global significance. Coastal erosion along the north coast of Alaska is chronic, widespread, may be accelerating, and is threatening defense and energy-related infrastructure, natural shoreline habitats, and Native communities. There is an increased demand for accurate information regarding past and present shoreline changes across the United States. To meet these national needs, the Coastal and Marine Geology Program of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) is compiling existing reliable historical shoreline data along sandy shores of the conterminous United States and parts of Alaska and Hawaii under the National Assessment of Shoreline Change project.
There is no widely accepted standard for analyzing shoreline change. Existing shoreline data measurements and rate calculation methods vary from study to study and prevent combining results into state-wide or regional assessments. The impetus behind the National Assessment project was to develop a standardized method of measuring changes in shoreline position that is consistent from coast to coast. The goal was to facilitate the process of periodically and systematically updating the results in an internally consistent manner.</abstract>
      <purpose>This dataset includes shorelines from ranging from 1947 to 2012 for the north coast of Alaska between the U.S.-Canadian Border and Icy Cape. Shorelines were compiled from T-sheets (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration), aerial orthophotographs (U.S. Geological Survey, ConocoPhillips and BP-Alaska), QuickBird satellite imagery (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service), and lidar (U.S. Geological Survey). Historical shoreline positions serve as easily understood features that can be used to describe the movement of beaches through time. These data are used to calculate rates of shoreline change for the U.S. Geological Survey's (USGS) National Assessment Project.
Rates of shoreline change were generated in a GIS using the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) version 4.3. DSAS uses a measurement baseline method to calculate rate-of-change statistics. Transects are cast from the reference baseline to intersect each shoreline, establishing measurement points used to calculate shoreline change rates.</purpose>

    <attracc>
      <attraccr>The data provided here are a compilation of shorelines from multiple sources, spanning 65 years. The attributes are based on the requirements of the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) software and have gone through a series of quality assurance procedures.</attraccr>
    </attracc>
    <logic>Adjacent shoreline segments do not overlap and are not necessarily continuous. Shorelines were quality checked for accuracy. Any slight offsets between adjacent segments due to georeferencing and digitizing error are taken into account in the uncertainty calculations included in the corresponding report.</logic>
    <complete>This shoreline file is complete and contains all shoreline segments used to calculate shoreline change rates along sections of the north coast of Alaska, between the U.S.-Canadian border and Icy Cape, where shoreline position data were available. These data adequately represented the shoreline position at the time of the survey. Remaining gaps in these data, if applicable, are a consequence of non-existing data or existing data that did not meet quality assurance standards.</complete>
    <posacc>
      <horizpa>
        <horizpar>Shoreline data have been acquired from 1947 to 2012, the horizontal accuracy of which varies with respect to data source from which the shorelines were digitized and the time period. Shorelines digitized from the 1940s T-sheets have an estimated total shoreline position uncertainty of plus or minus 16 meters. Shorelines generated from 1997-2007 orthophotos have an estimated total shoreline position uncertainty of plus or minus 3-4 meters. Shorelines generated from 2003 QuickBird imagery, 2002 and 2005 USGS Digital Orthophoto Quarter-Quadrangles(DOQQs), and 2010-2012 lidar data have an estimated total shoreline position uncertainty of plus or minus 6 meters. Please visit the ?Shoreline Position Uncertainty' section in the corresponding USGS Open-File Report (Gibbs and others, 2014; http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2015/1030/)for a complete explanation of the measurement uncertainties associated with these shorelines.</horizpar>

        <procdesc>Shoreline data were sought in an effort to compile as many quality shorelines as possible for the region. T-sheets were obtained from NOAA as scanned raster images. Aerial photos were acquired from USGS Alaska Science Center, ConocoPhillips, and BP-Alaska. QuickBird satellite imagery was acquired from U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Lidar data were acquired from USGS.</procdesc>

        <procdesc>T-sheets were geo-registered using Esri ArcMap software (v.9.3) by placing 8-20 well-spaced ground control points (GCP) at gridline intersections and applying a third order polynomial transformation. Some T-sheets may have required additional coordinate transformation information from NOAA to account for datum offsets between historical datums (USSD) and modern datums (NAD27 or NAD83). Datum transformations were applied to GCP coordinates prior to registration. Total RMS error for the rectification process was maintained below 0.0001 degrees, which is approximately 11 m at this latitude. Typically the resulting RMSE was much lower than 0.0001 degree.</procdesc>
