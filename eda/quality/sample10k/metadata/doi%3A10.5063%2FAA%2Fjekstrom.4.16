Combined with increased ocean uses and growing coastal populations, fragmented sector-based management is a source of today&#8217;s problems with ocean health, such as depleted fisheries, disappearing wetlands, and polluted beaches. Government and academia have clearly established the need for an integrated ecosystem-based approach to marine management to alleviate problems of fragmented management. However, in order to operationalize ecosystem-based management (EBM), the morass of law governing the ocean needs to be better understood so that place-specific problems can be prioritized and targeted in EBM planning.


	Recognizing the growing need to provide objective analyses of ocean management, my dissertation project focused on exploring ways to answer questions about gaps and overlaps in management using this compilation of laws. 

	The compilation encompasses marine and coastal relevant codified State laws and regulations for Washington, Oregon, and California, and federal United States laws and regulations. The geographic scope of the dissertation project is the California Current Large Marine Ecosystem. There are 74,251 sections of law represented in these data, which are derived from 1,388 parent documents of law. The dataset is composed of individual term frequencies for every stemmed word in the collection (not including common words, such as &quot;and&quot;, &quot;a&quot;, &quot;the&quot;.</para></abstract><keywordSet><keyword>Water Management</keyword><keywordThesaurus>None</keywordThesaurus></keywordSet><keywordSet><keyword>Marine Environment Monitoring</keyword><keywordThesaurus>None</keywordThesaurus></keywordSet><keywordSet><keyword>Marine Habitat</keyword><keywordThesaurus>None</keywordThesaurus></keywordSet><keywordSet><keyword>Marine law</keyword><keyword>Governance</keyword><keyword>Management</keyword><keywordThesaurus>None</keywordThesaurus></keywordSet><additionalInfo><para>Please note that this is a work in progress.

To include a law in the analysis of this project it must fulfill three criteria: 1. geographic scope, 2. scale of social organization, and 3. type of document. Collecting within the defined criteria produced a consistent collection of laws so that we could quantitatively answer fragmentation questions relevant to national and state levels, as well as between jurisdictions.</para><para>1. Geographic scope</para><para>In terms of geographic scope, these documents had to have power or influence over managing the activities that affect resources in the northern California Current Large Marine Ecosystem. To improve management of the marine environment, the international organizations, and national and state governments have adopted the Large Marine Ecosystem (LME) concept. On the magnitude of 200,000 km2, LMEs &#8220;are regions of ocean space encompassing coastal areas from river basins and estuaries to the seaward boundaries of continental shelves, enclosed and semi-enclosed seas, and the outer margins of the major current systems.&#8221; LMEs spatially cover the most economically, politically, and ecologically important portions of the oceans worldwide . The California Current Large Marine Ecosystem consists of one of the most well-documented marine ecosystems in the world . Located from the Washington State-Canada border to just south of Baja, the California Current LME extends seaward to approximately 300-600 nautical miles from the continent. Political jurisdictions for this area include international policy, the United States and Mexico national laws, as well as State laws from Washington, Oregon and California. Mexico marine waters are under the jurisdiction of the national government; therefore, no Mexican laws below the national level were compiled for this project.</para><para>2. Scale of social organization</para><para>The second criterion was that the laws were limited to national and state levels. The inclusion of additional levels of management, such as county, regional, and city, would provide a finer scale of analysis, but there are thousands of localities within the geographic scope. Therefore, due to time constraints, it was not feasible to identify and gather laws from the smaller-scale jurisdictions.</para><para>3. Type of law</para><para>The third criterion was that laws must be codified statutes or administrative code (regulations) for state and federal levels. Codified versions of laws are used because these are the most accessible. Additionally, the publicly accessible digital format throughout all relevant jurisdictions is updated regularly. For example, the updated code does not include repetitive text from a reauthorized act that existed in the original version. The aim of this collection was to gather relevant laws for one point in time, for which codified laws were the most appropriate. For documents at the international level, this criterion included treaties, agreements, or other relevant documents that are part of the Marine Mammal Commission Compendium. The specific routine used to collect for each jurisdiction is presented below. Collecting with criteria Digital versions of laws and regulations were manually collected for the international, national, and state level of the California Current LME, including laws from Washington, Oregon and California, as well as federal level laws and regulations of the United States. In additional, relevant international agreements and conventions were compiled. The identification and collection of this corpus was conducted from January through November 2006.</para><para>United States</para><para>We used the list of marine laws from the NOAA Coastal Services Center&#8217;s Digital Legislative Atlas to determine the United States Code portion of our collection. These documents were downloaded off the internet from the U.S. Office of Law Revision. The national regulations were chosen from the Federal Code of Regulations with a search on &#8220;marine&#8221; and &#8220;ocean.&#8221; There were 670 Parts that met the collection criteria.</para><para>California</para><para>To select the California State portion of our collection, we used a list of codified statutes was produced by Jonathon Gurish for the Ocean Protection Council, which identified relevant codified statutes to the ocean and coast for the State of California. These documents were gathered from the California Code website (http://www.leginfo.ca.gov). To determine relevant California regulations, the administrative code was searched using the terms &#8220;marine,&#8221; &#8220;ocean&#8221; and &#8220;coast&#8221; on the California Code of Regulations website (http://www.oal.ca.gov/). The California Code of Regulations that contained one or more occurrence of these terms was marked for collection.</para><para>Oregon</para><para>Oregon Revised Code relevant to this project was identified through the updated list in the Oregon Territorial Sea Plan. Additionally, we search for &#8220;marine,&#8221; &#8220;ocean&#8221; and &#8220;coast&#8221; on the Oregon Revised Statutes website (http://www.leg.state.or.us/ors/). To determine the relevant Oregon regulations, the Oregon Administrative Code was searched using &#8220;marine,&#8221; &#8220;ocean&#8221; and &#8220;coast&#8221; (http://arcweb.sos.state.or.us/banners/rules.htm).</para><para>Washington</para><para>Applicable Washington codified statutes were determined by searching &#8220;marine,&#8221; &#8220;ocean&#8221; and &#8220;coast&#8221; on the Revised Statutes of Washington website (http://search.leg.wa.gov/pub/textsearch). To identify the pertinent State regulations, Washington Administrative Code was searched using &#8220;marine,&#8221; &#8220;ocean&#8221; and &#8220;coast&#8221; (http://apps.leg.wa.gov/wac/). Each section was individually skimmed to determine whether the term &#8220;marine&#8221; referred to the ocean or to rights associated with individuals involved with the U.S. Marines. The latter were discarded from the collection list. The remaining sections were collected within their larger partitions.</para></section></description><instrumentation>Manual copy and pasting from government websites</instrumentation></methodStep><methodStep><description><section><title>Remove excess markup (California-specific)</title><para>Removing Barclay mark-up from California Code of Regulations</para><para>The following contains detailed instructions for cleaning the California Code of Regulations.</para><para>You will need two programs for this process: Microsoft Word and TextPad.

Digin Pro software package was used to divide source documents in the smaller legal sections to prepare for text analysis. DigIn Software allows a user to divide documents into pieces of any size based on the structure of the documents and then renames all new pieces by adding a chronological numeric suffix to the original document name.</para><para>The hierarchical structures in which the laws are codified vary. For example, the U.S. Code hierarchy in Title/Chapter/Section, and Chapters were collected. The California Code of Regulations hierarchy includes Title/Division/Chapter/Section, for which Division was collected as the source document. The larger partition was compiled to assure the collection of any relevant context that surrounds individual ocean-related sections. Laws within the scope of this project shared the structure of sections as the smallest cohesive elements of law. DigIn Pro softwarewas used to divide the large partitions of laws (referred to as &quot;source documents&quot;) into legal sections. Each source document was divided into sections so the structural composition of the collection would be consistent. Because each jurisdiction&#8217;s laws were written in a different format, we created regular expressions for each jurisdiction. DigIn Pro allows a user to divide individual documents or a set of documents into user-defined elements. In some cases, many laws within a single jurisdiction were written inconsistently, so unique regular expressions were created to correctly divide individual source documents.</para><para>The resulting collection of laws included United States (federal), California, Oregon and Washington codified statutes and regulations, and international agreements, totaling 1,388 source documents (unprocessed) which were divided into 74,251 sections.</para></section></description><instrumentation>DigIn Pro software, Tierit</instrumentation></methodStep><methodStep><description><section><title>Remove DigIn mark-up and convert to text</title><para>With the complete parsed collection, a Perl script was written to convert the newly divided laws into ASCII text format and remove final markup added by DigIn Pro. Because DigIn was developed as a tool to create online digital libraries, the parsing feature outputted the sections as individual *.htm documents. Also because the software was tailored to create online libraries, it adds a few lines of markup to each element, which is used similar to a Dewey decimal system by documenting the source document of every element. Additionally, DigIn system adds hyperlinks to each element automatically. A Perl script was written to remove all DigIn markup from each element.</para></section></description><instrumentation>Perl</instrumentation></methodStep><methodStep><description><section><title>Generate term-document matrix</title><para>Drs.

After common words were removed, the smallest document contained one word, and the longest document contained 152,000 words. However, the mean was 307.6, median was 116, and the mode was 8 words per document. Because the standard deviation was so high (1349), quartiles were measured. These showed that 75% of the collection had 271 or less words per document. The box plot demonstrates the quartiles. The plot reveals that 50% of the data are between 49 and 271 words per document, producing an interquartile range of 222. The upper whisker is much longer than the lower whisker. The extreme values (outliers) are all above the upper whisker, reaching over 100,000.</para><para>Summary Statistics &#8211;Terms</para><para>The global frequencies of terms within the law collection resulted in a sigmoidal trend. This shows that the majority of terms are relatively rare among the laws, which is the same pattern apparent in the number of documents containing each term. Document frequency per term demonstrates that most terms appear in a small amount of the laws. The box plot of quartiles  showed that 75% of the terms appear in 20 or less sections of law in the collection. The middle two quartiles (25% to 75% of the terms), which have a more representative distribution of the document frequencies, reveal that that each of these terms occurs in only 3 to 20 sections of law. The high variability of term frequencies throughout the collection calls for the application of weightings to the raw frequency counts. Various weightings, such as inverse document frequency and other global weightings should be explored in any vector space modeling applied to this dataset.</para><para>To document the summary statistics of this dataset, we document the most frequently occurring terms in the collection.
